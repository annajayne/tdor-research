===== Charlotte Police Have Hot Lead In Strange Killing =====

Charlotte N.C. April 27.— (UP)— Believing themselves on a ''hot trail,” Charlotte police today redoubled their efforts to solve the mystery surrounding the strange death of Albert Rudisill, whose body, dressed in a woman's clothing, was found last Saturday morning hanging from a beam in a warehouse where he worked.

Frank Littlejohn chief of detectives revealed that he questioned five people yesterday one of whom is still under suspicion. At this house, he said, were found bloodstains; a piece of a box identical with another found with the body; a portion of a woman's dress similar to that which shrouded the body, and "other important evidence" which was not made public.

Two other persons, who identities were not revealed, were believed to have accompanied this suspect to the warehouse about the time when physicians said Rudisill met death, and were being sought.

No one had been arrested.

Rudisill's body was found after his wife stared a search when he failed to come home last Friday night. In addition to the woman's dress, his ears bore earbobs, and cheeks and lips had been vividly colored with rouge and lipstick. A towel which police said bore similar lipstick was fond at the home of the man now under suspicion. Over the eyes of the dead man had been placed heavy rubber goggles.

It was the grotesque make-ip of the body which caused the police to abandon an early suicide theory. A large piece of woman's underclothing had been rammed down Rudisill's throuat, but his body bore no marks of violence.
