===== CHARLOTTE MYSTERY NEAR SOLUTION =====

==== Police Learn the Names of Rudisills Companions ====

Charlotte April 26— (AP) — With the knowledge that three persons were with Albert Rudisill, 24, about the time he met death last Friday, city detectives today predicted an early explanation of what they called the iost mysterious case in police annals here.

Officers were reticent in discussing their progress, lest revelations make their quarry harder to find, but revealed that the name of one man definitely connected with the case is known to them, and that his arrest is merely a matter of time.

Rudisill’s body, dressed in a woman's clothes, with earbobs and lipstick on, goggles over the eyes and a large piece of female underclothing wadded down the throat was found hanging from a beam in the warehouse where he worked Saturday morning.

Coroner Frank Hovis at first classed it a case of suicide, but the strange clothing caused a more intensive investigation which led to adoption of a murder theory instead.

Police learned of Rudisll’s companions on the fatal day from an itinerant salesman whose name they did not reveal.
