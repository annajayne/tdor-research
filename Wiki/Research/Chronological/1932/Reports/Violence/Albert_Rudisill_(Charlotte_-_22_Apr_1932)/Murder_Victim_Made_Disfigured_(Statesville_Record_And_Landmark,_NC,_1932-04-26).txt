===== Victim of Murder Is Made Hideous and Disfigured =====

==== Slayer of Charlotte Shipping Clerk Believed to Have Been a Degenerate. ====

Charlotte. April 25.—Inspector F. N. Littlejohn expressed belief that Albert Rudisill. 24, shipping clerk, whose body was found m a warehouse here clad in a woman's clothing, was the victim of a degenerate slayer.

"Only a perverted mind would think of making a murder victim look hideous and disgraceful by garbing it in women's apparel and otherwise disfiguring it," said the chief of Charlotte detectives.

Littlejohn said there was no possibility Rudisill killed himself. He said an examination of the body disclosed the tongue was inverted, forced down the throat by which had been rammed into the mouth.

When Rudisill's body was found Saturday, it was hanging from a frame in the warehouse by a woman's coat twisted into a rope and tied around the neck. Coroner Frank Ilovis at that time expressed the opinion Rudisill had killed himself. He said death was due to strangulation.

Littlejohn said the dress had been identified as belonging to an underworld character and she was being sought for questioning. Her name was not revealed. Thc detective said he was following thc theory that Rudisill was killed elsewhere and his body carried to thc warehouse where the young man was employed.

Rudisill was married. His 23-year-old wife, mother of a five-year-old daughter, asserted he had no financial or domestic worries and no reason to take his own life. She said the woman's clothing in which the body was clad was not hers and she had never seen it before. The shipping clerk disappeared Friday night and his wife launched a search for him, but the body was not discovered until other employes entered the warehouse Saturday morning.

Rudisill's own clothing was hanging in a closet in thc warehouse. His employer said Rudisill's services—he had worked for the company two years—were satisfactory.
