> On Monday, the trial against Sebastián Walter, accused of the 2013 femicide of Jorgelina Fernández in San Nicolás, will conclude in Criminal Court No. 1. After that incident, the man fled to Peru, met "Dulce" Centeno Taipe, and, after robbing her, murdered her. He was arrested and convicted in that country. When he returned to Argentina, he was captured and, 12 years later, is on trial for the murder of the young woman from San Nicolás.

> Sebastián Jesús Walter is being tried in the Nicolás Maduro courts. Next Monday, the parties will present their prosecution and defense arguments in TOC No. 1, which will conclude the trial. The verdict will be announced shortly thereafter, on a date yet to be confirmed. He is accused of beating to death Jorgelina Soledad Fernández, a 26-year-old mother of two young children from Ramallo, whose body was found in 2013 near the Sanctuary of San Nicolás.
> 
> Walter, her ex-partner, was implicated in the crime. Walter, her ex-partner, had been accused of sexual abuse by the young woman shortly before, in February. The man under investigation could not be arrested at the time because he had fled the city. Days after Jorgelina's body was found, Peruvian media published a photo of Sebastián Walter, taken in Peru when he was arrested for the murder of "Dulce" Centeno Taipe, a trans woman of that nationality, whom he had met during his escape and from whom he had also allegedly stolen $40,000. He was tried for that crime and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After serving his sentence, he returned to the country in 2023 and was arrested for the murder of the young woman from Ramallah. Furthermore, in 2024, the Second Criminal Court convicted him of aggravated sexual abuse, an offense that had been reported some time before the murder.

> When the crime for which she is now on trial became known, the pages of EL NORTE reported that the young woman had been brutally beaten and that her death was caused by bleeding at the base of her skull. At the time of discovery, her body was found half-naked, lying against one of the columns of the monument located in the Parque Perón plaza. They noted that there was a large bloodstain at the scene and that no clothing or documentation could be found that could quickly identify the deceased.
> 
> Shortly after, it was learned that the victim was Jorgelina Soledad Fernández, a mother of two minor children, ages 6 and 2, who was originally from the city of Ramallo and lived near the so-called Camino Negro. Her childhood and adolescence had been spent in various children's homes.
> 
> Walter, the victim's ex-partner, had been sought since the body was identified and his arrest warrant issued. The investigation revealed a call from Jorgelina's alleged killer from the city of Rosario. He then reportedly changed his cell phone number, and no further information about his whereabouts emerged until April 10, 2013.
> 
> Crime in Peru
> A few days after the body was found, the man accused of killing Jorgelina Fernández was arrested in Peru for the murder of a trans woman. Peruvian media reported that Argentine Sebastián Jesús Walter had been arrested in Lima for the murder of Centeno Taipe, a trans woman known as "Dulce." The accused, according to the report, had confessed to the murder of Centeno, from whom he had also allegedly stolen $40,000. He stated that he had met her on the trip from Argentina.
> 
> The body of Centeno Taipe, 38, was found half-naked and showing signs of asphyxiation in a hostel room in Santa Anita, Lima province. After the incident, Walter hid in another hostel in the same district. After being arrested, he led authorities to the 25th block of Avenida Ferrocarril, where he had hidden a bag containing clothing, personal belongings, and even the victim's passport.
> 
> Centeno Taipe's family had already reported the disappearance of money and suitcases from the room where she had stayed with the accused, with whom she had arrived from Argentina a few days earlier.
> 
> According to Peruvian police reports at the time, the foreigner fled overland from our country after committing the murder of Jorgelina Fernández and met Centeno along the way, with whom he became friends. They also stated that he had arrived in Lima "a few days ago." Regarding the murder of "Dulce," police sources indicated that Walter and his victim—both intoxicated—had allegedly argued loudly in the hostel room where they were staying, from where, they claimed, the approximately $40,000 Centeno Taipe told his relatives he had brought from Argentina for cosmetic surgery, which was the proceeds of his savings, disappeared.
> 
> At the time, the news was the headline of most Peruvian media outlets. "He murdered, fled, and murdered again," was the headline in that country's April 2013 issue of the Argentine Sebastián Walter.
