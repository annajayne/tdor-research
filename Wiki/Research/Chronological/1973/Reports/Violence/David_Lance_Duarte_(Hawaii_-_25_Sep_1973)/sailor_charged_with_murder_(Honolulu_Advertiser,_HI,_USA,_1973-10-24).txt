===== sailor charged with murder =====

A Navy spokesman said yesterday that PO 1.C. Thomas Paul Jones, 25, has been charged with murder, larceny, and assault and battery in the Sept. 25 death of 20-year-old David Lance Duarte.

Duarte's body — dressed in women's clothing — was found on Barbers Point beach the same day.

Jones, stationed at Barbers Point Naval Air Station, Squadron VR-21, is being held at the Pearl Harbor Correctional Center.

He was charged Thursday and has been in custody since Oct. 16, pending possible court-martial. Jones is being defended by Marine Capt. Charles T. Kleintop of the Pearl Harbor Law Center, according to the spokesman.
