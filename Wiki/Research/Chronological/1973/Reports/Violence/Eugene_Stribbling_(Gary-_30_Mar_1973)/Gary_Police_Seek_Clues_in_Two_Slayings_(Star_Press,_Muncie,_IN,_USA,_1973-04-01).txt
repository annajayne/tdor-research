===== Gary Police Seek Clues in Two Slayings =====

GARY, Ind. (UPI) — Gary police this weekend were seeking to solve the slayings of two female impersonators, one of them found stabbed to death Friday.

Eugene Stribbling, 26, Gary, was the latest victim, authorities said. He was found dead in the bedroom of his apartment here.

Police said Stribbling was the second of two female impersonators arrested March 1 in a narcotics raid at the M and M Motel to have been slain. Authorities said they had no suspects.

Stribbling was reported to be on unauthorized leave from the Norman M. Beatty Memorial Hospital at Westville. He was committed there in 1966 on a Lake Criminal Court order that also declared him mentally unfit to stand trial for the murder of Richard J. Westbrook, 33, Gary.
