Charles Blanchard, 31, was shot twice in the head as they were forced to stand next to a fence in an alley behind their mother's home at 2686 Connecticut St., Gary, Indiana on 5 Mar., 1973.

They had been released three days earlier following a police raid on a room at the M & M Motel where 10 people were arrested on narcotics charges.

They were identified as a female impersonator in a news report later that month when a second transgender person, Eugene Stribbling, 26, also arrested during the motel raid, was stabbed to death.
