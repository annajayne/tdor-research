===== Police Seeking Clues In Gary Stabbing Death =====
 
STAR STATE REPORT

Gary, Ind. Eugene Stribbling, 26, Gary, was found stabbed to death in the bedroom of his apartment here yesterday morning.

Police have no suspects, but said he is the second female impersonator who was arrested in a March 1 narcotics raid at the M and M Motel, to have been murdered.

Stribbling was on unauthorized leave from the Dr. Norman M. Beatty Memorial Hospital at Westville where he was committed in 1966. A Lake Criminal Court judge at that time declared him mentally unfit to stand trial for the murder of Richard J. Westbrook, 33, Gary.
