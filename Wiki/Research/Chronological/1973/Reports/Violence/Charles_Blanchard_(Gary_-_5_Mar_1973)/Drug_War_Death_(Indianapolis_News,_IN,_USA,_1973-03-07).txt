Drug War Death

GARY, Ind. (UPI) — The drug wars in Gary apparently claimed another victim. Police found the body of Charles Blanchard, 31, Monday night in an alley in downtown Gary, shot twice in the head.

Blanchard, arrested last week in a drug raid and only recently released, was shot at close range as he was forced to stand next to a fence, police said.
