===== Man Slain; '73 Gary Drug War Toll 3 =====

STAR STATE REPORT

Gary, Ind. — The third victim this year of the Gary drug war was found shot twice in the head behind the home of his mother. Police have theorized narcotics dealers believed he was a police informer.

The slain man, Charles Blanchard, 31, Gary, was found dead in an alley late Monday. Police said he was slain at the scene behind the home of Marcella Wortham, his mother.

Blanchard was one of 10 arrested last week when police staged a drug raid at the M and M Motel. He also had appeared at least six times before a special Federal grand jury investigating the drug war here which in 1972 claimed 22 lives.

Narcotics detectives yesterday were questioning members of the Family, street gang which they say started the drug war in an effort to take over the narcotics trade at Gary.

Detectives said they had reason to believe that some of those arrested last week thought Blanchard had co-operated with police in setting up the raid.

Police also yesterday were searching for Garland Jeffers, 26, head of the Family. Jeffers was released from the Indiana State Reformatory last week and a warrant later was issued charging him with a 1968 murder here.
