Gangman Executed

GARY — An associate of the Family street gang was found shot to death Monday behind 2686 Connecticut Ave.

Dead is Charles Blanchard, 31, of 411 Delaware St.

He was shot in the head.

The address at which he was found is the home of Grover Barnes, 27, said by police to be a drug dealer involved in the drug war with the Family.

Blanchard was one of 10 people picked up in a raid March 1 at the M and M Hotel at 1420 Washington St., where drugs and guns were confiscated. A Family member, Isaac Davis, was arrested in the raid.

The hotel is a Family hangout, said police. Blanchard was released March 2.
