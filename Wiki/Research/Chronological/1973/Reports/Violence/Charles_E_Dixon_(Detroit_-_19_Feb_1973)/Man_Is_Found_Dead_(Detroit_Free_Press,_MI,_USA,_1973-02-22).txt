===== Man Is Found Dead =====

The partially decomposed body of a 32-year-old man dressed in women's clothes was found Wednesday in the basement of his northwest Detroit home.

Police said Charles E. Dixon, of 19193 Forrer, had been shot through the head some time after Monday when he last was seen.

The body was discovered by a friend, Curtis Hamell, 17, of 1456 Liebold.

**HAMMEL** was held in the investigation. When arrested he had $100 in cash and diamond rings which he said were presents that had been given to him.

Sgt. James Walker of the Detroit police homicide section said 46 women's wigs were found in the home which had television sets in nearly every room, including the attic, basement and bathroom.

At the side entrance was a closed circuit television camera which police believe was used to monitor visitors, Walker said police confiscated from the house "considerable paraphernalia which was narcotics related."

Dixon last year was charged but acquitted in the fatal shooting of a foreign seaman who was killed in a southwest Detroit riverfront bar.
