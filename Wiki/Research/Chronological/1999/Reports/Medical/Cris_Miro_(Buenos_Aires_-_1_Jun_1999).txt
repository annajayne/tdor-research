> Cris Miró and his childhood marked by adversity
> He was born Gerardo Elías Virgues into a middle-class family. His childhood was marked by a difficult reality: he grew up in the midst of the last military dictatorship , a context fraught with repression and fear.
> 
> Adding to this already complicated situation was an even more challenging personal experience. While in high school, she began to feel attracted to one of her classmates and was subjected to teasing, exclusion, and bullying.

> His first steps and rise to fame
> She studied dentistry and received formal education before taking the big leap in her professional career. In 1993, she was discovered by producer Juanito Belmonte after captivating him with her charm and changed her name to Cris Miró.
> 
> Given her innate talent, she quickly made her way to the Maipo Theater, one of the epicenters of revue theater in Buenos Aires, where she became the main star. For the first time, a trans woman headlined a high-profile show , at a time when most were condemned to marginalization or anonymity.

> A star who broke barriers
> People loved her and the audience cheered her, but offstage, the treatment she received was ambiguous, sometimes cruel. In interviews, journalists avoided using the word "trans," and some questions revolved around her body, her past, and her "true identity."
> 
> In 1995, Cris Miró was crowned Star of the Year . At that moment, she realized she had a clear dream: to succeed in her artistic career. For this reason, she specialized in dance and theater under the guidance of leading figures such as Julio Bocca and Alejandra Boero.
> 
> The artist took on a key role in the fight for equality, becoming an active voice in defense of the rights of LGBTIQ+ people. Her career led her to break barriers, to the point of being recognized as the first transgender woman to be respected and admired by Argentine society .

> The raw story behind Cris Miró, the first trans woman who challenged the spectacle and left a legacy on the Buenos Aires scene.
> A silent battle offstage
> In her later years, her health began to deteriorate , and she was forced to withdraw from the media. In 1995, she was admitted to Fernández Hospital. While some rumors suggested she had tested positive for HIV, it was reported that she had a lung condition.
> 
> Amid speculation about her delicate condition, those close to her repeatedly denied that Cris Miró had AIDS. She even publicly denied it herself in September 1998, after being hospitalized for contamination: "Don't make things up, I don't have AIDS."
> 
> The raw story behind Cris Miró, the first trans woman who challenged the spectacle and left a legacy on the Buenos Aires scene.
> The following years were very difficult for the young actress. In 1999, she was hospitalized three times. On Thursday, May 20, Cris Miró showed up at the Santa Isabel Sanatorium in the Caballito neighborhood with a fever, allergies, and intense chest pain. Her general condition was worrisome: she looked visibly thin and couldn't breathe.
> 
> A few days later, she was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer , which had progressed rapidly due to her age. On June 1, 1999, just four years after achieving stardom and at the age of 33, the diva passed away amidst mystery and conflicting rumors.




> Filming has begun on 'Cris Miró: The Exclusive TNT and Flow Biopic that Will Unravel the Trajectory of the First Argentine Transgender Woman to Achieve Fame as a Vedette and Transform the '90s.
> 
> The series, still without a release date, directed by Martín Vatenberg and Javier Van de Couter , will be headed by Mina Serrano playing Cris Miró. The cast will include outstanding performances by Katja Alemann, César Bordón, Agustín “Soy Rada” Aristarán, Vico D'Alessandro, Marcos Montes, Toto Rovito, Manu Fanego, Campi, and Adabel Guerrero, among others.
> 
> “Cris Miró” will immerse itself in the process of constructing the identity of Cris Miró, a pop icon who managed to make visible a group relegated to the shadows, paving the way for the trans people who followed him.
> 
> In 1995 Cris debuted in  Viva la magazine  in Maipo, led by  Lino Patalano  and thus burst onto the public scene.
> 
> From that moment on, she became famous, but not only for her talent but because  she represented what was a “strange” being for society: a transvestite .
> 
> At that time,  trans people  were identified with marginality: prostitutes, criminals or psychiatric patients.  What Cris contributed was the possibility of showing another side of transvestism, the artistic side .
> 
> Its emergence onto the public scene unconsciously fueled a timid debate about those bodies that escape the dichotomy of masculine and feminine.
> 
> His figure was a kind of prologue  for what came many years later, the Gender Identity law.
> 
> What will the Cris Miró series of the first Argentine vedette be like?
> The eight-episode series   will cover her life and career until the moment when a stigmatizing diagnosis about her health shakes her plans and convinces her to make a tragic pact with herself: to disguise  her agony to die as beautiful as she lived  .
> 
> This story, based on the novel  Female, Cris Miró – Living and Dying in a Country of Machos by  Carlos Sanzol,  will come to give a new place of recognition to this magnetic woman, highlight her mark as a true revolutionary of the time and reflect a fight that continues to this day.
> 
> “In Cris, since his childhood, there was a genuine desire to identify with the feminine,” Sanzol told Clarín at the time . “However, it took her about 31 years to undergo a mammoplasty, in 1997. And two years later she died. Until 1995 she lived in doubles: by day she was a fairly androgynous boy and by night, Cris, a  femme fatale ." 
> 
> “This can be explained because  being  trans  in the time in which she lived meant accepting being arrested for wearing clothes of the opposite gender , as established by the Escándalo police edict that was in effect until 1999.”
> 
> “In addition,” Sanzol continues, “in his house, it was not something that had been allowed. However, with the armor that fame gave him, Cris was encouraged to have the operation. A work necessity also contributed to her decision: she opted to be a star and starlets do not simulate what is not there, they show it, they flaunt it. The lolas, in addition to a desire of their own, became a work necessity.”
> 
> You imply that Maradona and Cris Miró had a relationship. What was true in this?
> -It is one of the great unknowns of the book. Although there are testimonies that link  Diego  with Cris, especially from people in her inner circle, apparently they were friends of hers...
> 
> More answers will surely be found in the biopic that has already begun filming.

> Cris Miró would have turned 52 on September 16
> His irruption in the world of entertainment was brief, fleeting, but it was enough to open a gap, to mark a way forward. Cris Miró  was the first transvestite to be massively accepted by the public. After her, many more would come.
> 
> She was the first to star in a play on Corrientes Street, outside the commercial circuit. And it was she, thanks to her imposing figure and her histrionics, who in 1995 managed to be considered the Vedette of the Year, despite not having been born a woman.
> 
> The trans who knew how to conquer the public
> An emblematic figure of the 90s, he practically could not enjoy that opening that he had achieved ... Only four years after having reached fame, and at just 31 years old, Cris Miró died, wrapped in the deepest of mysteries and in the most absolute of silences.
> 
> On Thursday, May 20, 1999, the first trans to succeed in our country walked to the Santa Isabel sanatorium, in the Caballito neighborhood. It was his third hospital stay in less than six months and he could hardly speak. He had a fever, an allergy, and severe chest pains . Despite having entered the clinic on his own, he was weak, had lost several kilos and his blunt 1.85 in height was more emaciated than ever.
> 
> As in his other hospitalizations, everything was secretive. Neither her relatives nor the doctors who attended her wanted to explain what was the mysterious disease that was affecting the star of the moment.
> 
> Miró was admitted to room 307 of the clinic  under strict aseptic measures due to the low level of her defenses. A handwritten sign prohibited anyone from entering the room who was not authorized. Only her mother, Hilda de Virgues, could visit her, but before entering the room she  had to put on a cloak and mask . Rumors that he had AIDS were present again.
> 
> In 1997, when she was at the peak of her career and had already been considered the Vedette of the Year , an internment at the Fernández Hospital - where her older brother, Esteban worked - provoked the first wave of suspicion .
> 
> In those days, relatives and friends of the actress and dancer let it be known that the transvestite  had suffered a lung condition. However, unofficial sources indicated that he had been tested positive for HIV. The truth is that from that moment on,  his life alternated between performances and visits to doctors.
> 
> In September 1998,  Cris Miró had to undergo a long series of analyzes. According to her, she had consumed contaminated water, which caused intoxication that affected her red blood cells and consumed her energy. For the first time, the trans girl who had triumphed on Corrientes Street dared to speak about the versions of her illness, but she was final: "Don't invent more, I don't have AIDS," she said.
> 
> With his imposing figure and sensuality he displayed his first artistic weapons starring in musical shows
> A few months later, at the beginning of 1999, while doing a one-man show with two strippers on the Atlantic Coast, the star suffered a lumbar inflammation caused by a bad movement. From that moment on he had to infiltrate to be able to continue acting , but in the middle of the tour he couldn't bear the pain any more and decided to go to a clinic in Mar de Ajo. For this reason, he canceled all his presentations, and then returned to Buenos Aires to undergo clinical studies. His health was not good and he was beginning to worry.
> 
> On February 22, he entered the Sanatorio Del Norte so that specialists could make a diagnosis of the bone muscle injury: they performed a computed tomography and an MRI. Cris Miró thought it would only be a procedure, but the doctors ordered an urgent hospitalization.
> 
> After several days in the hospital, the transvestite was discharged, but had to follow a strict outpatient treatment that included rest, continuous medical control and the application of anti-inflammatories. Although she lacked two subjects to become a dentist, that year for the first time since she had entered the faculty, she did not register to take it and also gave up job offers in theater and live performances.



> On Thursday May 20, 1999, Cris Miró's life entered a cone of shadows: bedridden in a private room, she spent the last days of her life alone in the company of her mother. On Thursday the 27th everyone sensed that his life was near the end: his platelets had dropped too low and lymphatic cancer was beginning to rage.
> 
> That night they had to perform a blood transfusion and on Saturday the 29th, another one urgently. 48 hours later, on Monday, May 31, perhaps as a last wish, with the small voice that remained, he asked for the serum to be taken so that he could rest in peace.
> 
> The next morning, Tuesday, June 1, 1999, Cris Miró entered an irreversible coma . At 2.10 in the afternoon  his heart could not bear so much suffering and stopped beating.
> 
> Perhaps because of her youth or because of the speed at which the disease invaded her, her death caused surprise and a huge impact . It was the moment of crying, sadness and desolation.
> 
> According to the transcended, the causes of his death were varied and fueled endless rumors. To the silence of the doctors who treated her, the versions of her family and friends were added, who first took care to affirm that a lymphatic cancer had killed her.
> 
> In those days the Argentine Homosexual Community (CHA) began to recognize the gap opened by transvestites.  "Cris Miró suffered the worst disease: discrimination. However, he had the courage to be a person who publicly faced intolerance, from his work and his art," they highlighted from the body.
> 
> Cris Miró was born on September 19, 1968 , with the name of Gerardo Elías. Her father, Esteban Virgues, and her mother had conceived a boy, but as a child she felt something stronger than her nature.
> 
> He attended primary school in a mixed school that was in front of his house, in the Belgrano neighborhood, but when he entered secondary school, he entered a school that only boys attended. He was already a teenager who knew perfectly what his sexual choice was, and it was around that time that he met his first love: a tall, blond boy with a good physique, a year older than her.
> 
> His story was not easy . One afternoon, his father - an officer of the Navy - asked him what was wrong with him. Despite her 16-year-old fears, she responded with total sincerity, telling her what she felt and what she wanted for her life. His father, shocked by the news, only managed to give him a hug, and promised that he would always respect him.
> 
> Gerardo was beginning to disappear and Cris Miró was beginning to emerge . Years later, when her father was about to die and she was already one of the main stars of the Maipo theater, they hugged again. That time it was the father of the actress and dancer who asked her to fulfill a promise: she would never miss the theater.
> 
> In 1993, Juanito Belmonte discovered her at a cocktail party. Two years it took the transvestite girl to rise to fame. In 1995, her spectacular figure and huge green eyes led her to be consecrated as La Vedette of the Year .
> Although his was the low profile, the controversies did not take long to explode .
> 
> It was the cost he had to pay to open a trail. First, she faced Moría Casán, who disqualified her as an actress and star , and then, incredibly, she crossed paths with Florencia De La Ve, who would be, after her death, the person who obtained the greatest benefits from the path opened by Cris Miró.
> 
> However, of all the scandals,  his strongest dispute was with Raúl Portal and his son Gastón , to whom he sued for feeling discriminated against, injured and injured ...
> 
> "Although I was born with a certain sex, which makes having documents with name and gender of man, the most important thing is what I feel.  I'm just one person, and that's what matters to me. That the others see it opposites. I live it in only one way, "said Cris Miró.
> 
> On Wednesday June 2, 1999 at 10 am, his mortal remains left the funeral home to the Chacarita Cemetery, where they were cremated.
> 
> Although she never raised banners, nor did she proselytize, she always vindicated sexual freedom and fought to be recognized as a person. He never liked typecasting: transvestite, woman, man. She preferred to be classified as an artist, and that was her great merit, having crossed that border that places the transvestite with the marginal, and being accepted by society.
> 
> That same society, which when the moment of the last goodbye came, approached to say goodbye, offering her in a closed applause, all their affection and the greatest of respects.

> The intense and brief life of Cris Miró, Argentina's first trans star
> TNT is releasing today the biography of the artist who shot in the 90s and died at just 33 years old. A cultural icon and a reference of an era.
> A brief summary would say that she was the first great popular star of the trans community in Argentina, but the truth is that she meant much more than that. Her acceptance in the main social spheres, whether in “Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand” or heading to a Buenos Aires magazine, implied a unique and never before achieved space of visibility for an LGTBI + community that still suffered attacks and persecutions, at a time when police edicts against transvestism were still in force.
> 
> “ Cris Miró (she)” is the biopic of an artist who takes on the challenge of telling the short life of a cultural icon and emblem of a community, who left an indelible mark on its identity. Until its emergence, dissidence was accepted and circulated without hesitation in sectors of culture, art and intellectuality (and even in high society, which welcomed it with a curious look), but never before had it reached the mass level that the artist achieved in just a few years.
> 
> The first episode of the original production will premiere today at 10pm on TNT and a new one will be presented every Sunday, until the eight episodes of the series are complete, each lasting 30 minutes (with a repeat on Tuesdays at 10pm and Fridays at 11pm ). Tomorrow the entire episode will be uploaded to the Flow platform. The launch coincides with various proposals related to Pride Month, which concludes on Friday with International Pride Day.
> 
> The mystery surrounding the unexpected death of Cris Miró, the first trans woman to succeed as a showgirl
> The bet is to go through the brief existence and the intense career of Cris Miró, the first trans woman in the world of Argentine show business, a famous vedette who arrived at the marquee of the Maipo Theater in Buenos Aires in 1995 (she was chosen as the Vedette of the Year). “Sensual and ambitious, she saw the opportunity to present herself to the world as she really felt. She left behind her life and a genre that did not represent her, and built her identity as a magnetic woman who achieved, in the heat of fame, visibility and acceptance in Argentine society. However, a positive HIV diagnosis shook her plans and led her to disguise her agony and die as beautiful as she lived. “She meant a revolution and remains an emblem with a history of great relevance as a leading figure of the LGBTQ+ community and a pioneer of a struggle that is still current today,” it is anticipated in the previews.
> 
> The truth is that the artist had a brilliant but short presence (less than a decade); her time was enough to open paths with fruits that were seen many years later and to begin to break stereotypes, with a strong and firm presence, dark hair that enhanced her face and a body sculpted and worked in detail to enhance the feminine. To every off-color joke or to every question loaded with prejudice she responded with a smile, a knowing look and a lapidary and provocative answer, to make it clear that she did not shrink from anything.
> 
> Empowered and determined, she dominated in every media appearance. “When I was younger, like in my teens, I had in mind to have surgery. Then I got to know a little more about myself and the possibilities that life gives and now I am fine with my body, with my friends and with my family. I don't have that idea. The important thing is to be happy with the different possibilities that life gives us. “Not to have things denied and to enjoy everything,” she maintained.
> 
> The beginning
> 
> He was born in 1965 under the name of Gerardo Elías Virgues , but as a teenager he assumed his transsexuality, which he referred to with absolute naturalness, something unusual decades ago and which disoriented his interviewers who did not know how to address issues of gender identity.
> 
> “Even though I was born with a certain sex that means I have documents with a male name and gender, the most important thing is what I feel. I am one person, and that is what matters to me. Others see the opposites, I live it in one way only,” she said.
> 
> After finishing high school, Miró began studying dentistry at the University of Buenos Aires, and at the same time, she entered Julio Bocca 's dance academy (she later also studied with Maximiliano Guerra) and Alejandra Boero 's acting academy. In the mid-90s she was discovered by her agent Juanito Belmonte and began working in theater (both in serious plays and in Gerardo Sofovich 's picaresque comedies) and in movies (she was in the casts of “Dios los crea” by Fernando Ayala and “La peste” by Luis Puenzo ), but fame came to her as a vedette, with doors opened on television. At the peak of her social recognition, she died unexpectedly at the age of 33 on June 1, 1999, officially due to lymphoma detected while she was on the Atlantic Coast; the truth later came out.
> 
> Although she was initially resisted within her own social sector (she was criticized for receiving benevolent attention, while the rest were ignored or persecuted), her figure was later valued, to the point that her portrait was included in the exhibition “Argentine Icons” by Gianni Mestichelli .
> 
> A country of men
> La realización de TNT está basada en el libro “Hembra. Cris Miró - Vivir y morir en un país de machos”, escrito por Carlos Sanzol (publicado por la editorial Milena Caserola en 2016) y el guión fue firmado por Martín Vatenberg y Lucas Bianchini. Producida por Nativa y EO Media y dirigida por Martín Vatenberg en colaboración con Javier Van de Couter, está protagonizada por Mina Serrano y contará con las actuaciones estelares de Katja Alemann (interpreta a su madre Hilda), César Bordón, Agustín Soy Rada Aristarán, Vico D’Alessandro, Marcos Montes, Toto Rovito, Manu Fanego, Martín “Campi” Campilongo, Carolina Kopelioff, Alejandro Tantanian y Adabel Guerrero, entre otros (varios miembros del elenco la conocieron y compartieron noches con ella hace 30 años).
> 
> El despliegue que se anuncia para la pantalla apunta a recrear la estética, la coyuntura política y social y el show business de la época en que brilló Cris. “La serie abordará el proceso de construcción de identidad de un ícono pop que logró darle visibilidad a un colectivo que no encontraba otro destino más allá de la noche”, anticipan desde TNT.
> 
> UNIMITABLE. The Argentine actress and showgirl stood out in the mid-90s.
> INIMITABLE. La actriz y vedette argentina descolló a mediados de los 90.
> En la presentación de la serie, se exhibieron los vestuarios originales que Miró utilizó en sus actuaciones y se realizó una performance de baile que culminó con la aparición de la protagonista, quien es una actriz y vedette española nacida en Granda, que comenzó a los 17 años comenzó a estudiar la carrera de Arte Dramático en la Resad en Madrid. “La figura de Cris apela a la empatía y la libertad que todos llevamos dentro”, afirmó la actriz ibérica.
> 
> Hasta esta serie, Serrano -de notable parecido al personaje que interpreta y que realizó un trabajo vocal para dejar su acento castizo de lado- estuvo más vinculada a una carrera como performer con estilo propio y en colaboraciones con destacados artistas europeos, siempre relacionada con un mensaje de respeto, diversidad y empoderamiento del colectivo LGTBI+.
> 
> “Vivimos un momento en el que las minorías están siendo discriminadas nuevamente, y lo que sucedió en el pasado enfrenta una especie de reacciónSentimos que no había mejor momento para contar esta historia. La figura de Cris resuena con el deseo de los jóvenes de convertirse en quienes realmente quieren ser”, resaltó Eze Olzanski (dueño de EO Media) acerca del momento del estreno de la producción.
