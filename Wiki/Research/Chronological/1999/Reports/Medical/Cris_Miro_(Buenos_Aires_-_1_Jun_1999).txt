> Cris Miró would have turned 52 on September 16
> His irruption in the world of entertainment was brief, fleeting, but it was enough to open a gap, to mark a way forward. Cris Miró  was the first transvestite to be massively accepted by the public. After her, many more would come.
> 
> She was the first to star in a play on Corrientes Street, outside the commercial circuit. And it was she, thanks to her imposing figure and her histrionics, who in 1995 managed to be considered the Vedette of the Year, despite not having been born a woman.
> 
> The trans who knew how to conquer the public
> An emblematic figure of the 90s, he practically could not enjoy that opening that he had achieved ... Only four years after having reached fame, and at just 31 years old, Cris Miró died, wrapped in the deepest of mysteries and in the most absolute of silences.
> 
> On Thursday, May 20, 1999, the first trans to succeed in our country walked to the Santa Isabel sanatorium, in the Caballito neighborhood. It was his third hospital stay in less than six months and he could hardly speak. He had a fever, an allergy, and severe chest pains . Despite having entered the clinic on his own, he was weak, had lost several kilos and his blunt 1.85 in height was more emaciated than ever.
> 
> As in his other hospitalizations, everything was secretive. Neither her relatives nor the doctors who attended her wanted to explain what was the mysterious disease that was affecting the star of the moment.
> 
> Miró was admitted to room 307 of the clinic  under strict aseptic measures due to the low level of her defenses. A handwritten sign prohibited anyone from entering the room who was not authorized. Only her mother, Hilda de Virgues, could visit her, but before entering the room she  had to put on a cloak and mask . Rumors that he had AIDS were present again.
> 
> In 1997, when she was at the peak of her career and had already been considered the Vedette of the Year , an internment at the Fernández Hospital - where her older brother, Esteban worked - provoked the first wave of suspicion .
> 
> In those days, relatives and friends of the actress and dancer let it be known that the transvestite  had suffered a lung condition. However, unofficial sources indicated that he had been tested positive for HIV. The truth is that from that moment on,  his life alternated between performances and visits to doctors.
> 
> In September 1998,  Cris Miró had to undergo a long series of analyzes. According to her, she had consumed contaminated water, which caused intoxication that affected her red blood cells and consumed her energy. For the first time, the trans girl who had triumphed on Corrientes Street dared to speak about the versions of her illness, but she was final: "Don't invent more, I don't have AIDS," she said.
> 
> With his imposing figure and sensuality he displayed his first artistic weapons starring in musical shows
> A few months later, at the beginning of 1999, while doing a one-man show with two strippers on the Atlantic Coast, the star suffered a lumbar inflammation caused by a bad movement. From that moment on he had to infiltrate to be able to continue acting , but in the middle of the tour he couldn't bear the pain any more and decided to go to a clinic in Mar de Ajo. For this reason, he canceled all his presentations, and then returned to Buenos Aires to undergo clinical studies. His health was not good and he was beginning to worry.
> 
> On February 22, he entered the Sanatorio Del Norte so that specialists could make a diagnosis of the bone muscle injury: they performed a computed tomography and an MRI. Cris Miró thought it would only be a procedure, but the doctors ordered an urgent hospitalization.
> 
> After several days in the hospital, the transvestite was discharged, but had to follow a strict outpatient treatment that included rest, continuous medical control and the application of anti-inflammatories. Although she lacked two subjects to become a dentist, that year for the first time since she had entered the faculty, she did not register to take it and also gave up job offers in theater and live performances.



> On Thursday May 20, 1999, Cris Miró's life entered a cone of shadows: bedridden in a private room, she spent the last days of her life alone in the company of her mother. On Thursday the 27th everyone sensed that his life was near the end: his platelets had dropped too low and lymphatic cancer was beginning to rage.
> 
> That night they had to perform a blood transfusion and on Saturday the 29th, another one urgently. 48 hours later, on Monday, May 31, perhaps as a last wish, with the small voice that remained, he asked for the serum to be taken so that he could rest in peace.
> 
> The next morning, Tuesday, June 1, 1999, Cris Miró entered an irreversible coma . At 2.10 in the afternoon  his heart could not bear so much suffering and stopped beating.
> 
> Perhaps because of her youth or because of the speed at which the disease invaded her, her death caused surprise and a huge impact . It was the moment of crying, sadness and desolation.
> 
> According to the transcended, the causes of his death were varied and fueled endless rumors. To the silence of the doctors who treated her, the versions of her family and friends were added, who first took care to affirm that a lymphatic cancer had killed her.
> 
> In those days the Argentine Homosexual Community (CHA) began to recognize the gap opened by transvestites.  "Cris Miró suffered the worst disease: discrimination. However, he had the courage to be a person who publicly faced intolerance, from his work and his art," they highlighted from the body.
> 
> Cris Miró was born on September 19, 1968 , with the name of Gerardo Elías. Her father, Esteban Virgues, and her mother had conceived a boy, but as a child she felt something stronger than her nature.
> 
> He attended primary school in a mixed school that was in front of his house, in the Belgrano neighborhood, but when he entered secondary school, he entered a school that only boys attended. He was already a teenager who knew perfectly what his sexual choice was, and it was around that time that he met his first love: a tall, blond boy with a good physique, a year older than her.
> 
> His story was not easy . One afternoon, his father - an officer of the Navy - asked him what was wrong with him. Despite her 16-year-old fears, she responded with total sincerity, telling her what she felt and what she wanted for her life. His father, shocked by the news, only managed to give him a hug, and promised that he would always respect him.
> 
> Gerardo was beginning to disappear and Cris Miró was beginning to emerge . Years later, when her father was about to die and she was already one of the main stars of the Maipo theater, they hugged again. That time it was the father of the actress and dancer who asked her to fulfill a promise: she would never miss the theater.
> 
> In 1993, Juanito Belmonte discovered her at a cocktail party. Two years it took the transvestite girl to rise to fame. In 1995, her spectacular figure and huge green eyes led her to be consecrated as La Vedette of the Year .
> Although his was the low profile, the controversies did not take long to explode .
>

> It was the cost he had to pay to open a trail. First, she faced Moría Casán, who disqualified her as an actress and star , and then, incredibly, she crossed paths with Florencia De La Ve, who would be, after her death, the person who obtained the greatest benefits from the path opened by Cris Miró.
> 
> However, of all the scandals,  his strongest dispute was with Raúl Portal and his son Gastón , to whom he sued for feeling discriminated against, injured and injured ...
> 
> "Although I was born with a certain sex, which makes having documents with name and gender of man, the most important thing is what I feel.  I'm just one person, and that's what matters to me. That the others see it opposites. I live it in only one way, "said Cris Miró.
> 
> On Wednesday June 2, 1999 at 10 am, his mortal remains left the funeral home to the Chacarita Cemetery, where they were cremated.
> 
> Although she never raised banners, nor did she proselytize, she always vindicated sexual freedom and fought to be recognized as a person. He never liked typecasting: transvestite, woman, man. She preferred to be classified as an artist, and that was her great merit, having crossed that border that places the transvestite with the marginal, and being accepted by society.
> 
> That same society, which when the moment of the last goodbye came, approached to say goodbye, offering her in a closed applause, all their affection and the greatest of respects.
