Fred M Lewis, 37, was stabbed and killed with a butcher knife by Thomas B. Glynn, Jr during a kitchen party in a rooming house in Denver, Colorado on the evening of 20 June 1923. Thomas claimed it was in self-defense and that he stabbed Fred because he was afraid for his life. He was charged with first degree murder, but was acquitted at trial on Oct 14th, 1923.

After the acquittal was read, Thomas' father, Thomas B Glynn, Sr., accused the prosecution of "shielding a band of criminals" and "preventing the introduction of evidence showing the nature of the place that Lewis had conducted."
