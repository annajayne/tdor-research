===== STABBER FREE; PLEA DEFENSE =====

==== Killed Female Impersonator in Gay Party in Flat. ====

Denver, Oct. 14.—The jury of the Denver district court tonight brought in a verdict of "not guilty" for Thomas B.  Glynn, formerly of New Orleans, who has been on trial here for first degree murder. Glynn stabbed to death Fred Lewis, of Denver, a female impersonator, June 20 this year. Glynn pleaded self-defense.

Glynn, a 20-year-old vocational student, and, according to the evidence at the way to the summer school of the University of Colorado at Boulder, and had stopped off here for a day. They had been invited to a party in a downtown apartment and according to the evidence at. the trial, liquor had been served. Glynn claimed that Lewis attacked him, that he grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed him when he feared for his life.

Deputy District Attorney L. D. Mowry who conducted the prosecution of Glynn, refused tonight to comment on the verdict which was read to Judge Samuel W. Johnson by Clerk McLachlin at 7:30 this evening.

"Merely a part of the day's work," was all he would say.

Thomas B. Glynn, senior, father of the accused youth, came here from New Orleans, where he is said to be prominent, to defend his son, and testified to his good reputation in New Orleans. The young wife was also a witness, and testified as to incidents at the party that had the tragic ending.

=== Father and Prosecutor Clash. ===

After the verdict of acquittal by the jury had been read, Thomas B. Glynn, Sr., accused Deputy District Attorney Mowry of shielding an organized band of criminals here. He charged the prosecutor with preventing the introduction of evidence showing the nature of the place that Lewis had conducted, and charged also that he had suppressed this evidence in order to convict his son.  A heated altercation between the father of the defendant and the attorney continued until they were separated.  Young Glynn showed little emotion when the verdict was read. Besides his wife, father and mother, and the court attaches, the court room was empty.

=== Drink Made One Juror Stubborn ===

Charles T. Mahoney, who defended Glynn in the trial, attempted to thank the jury but was halted by Judge Johnson. Mr. Mahoney said later in the evening that he had learned that the jury had remained out nearly 24 hours, not that they considered Glynn guilty, but because one of the jurors had sought to find some way for punishing him for drinking.
