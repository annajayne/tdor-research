Denver.—Fred Lewis, 37, proprietor of a rooming house at 1308 Glenarm place, was stabbed to death, following what police say was a wild party in the kitchen of the house. Thomas B. Glyn, 20, a student, living in the rooming house, is said to have confessed to Detective George Eads that he stabbed Lewis with a butcher knife. He was arrested in his room and taken to police headquarters where the confession was made.
