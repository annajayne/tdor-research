===== Hunt Motive in Weird Rampage Fatal to 5 =====

(Special to THE NEWS)

.Uniontown, Pa., Feb. 21.—Police were baffled today in their search for the motive for the five-day murder rampage of a crazed steelworker who massacred his wife, his daughter, two men and himself.

"It's definitely a case of four murders and a suicide." Coroner W. Kalston McGee said. "It is the worst case of its kind I've ever seen. There were no notes nothing to indicate the motive."

As police reconstructed it, Robert Miller, 42, first slew his wife, Helen. 41, and buried her in the coal cellar. Next he killed his daughter, Doris, 17, who was found wearing only a slip and panties.

==== In Women's Clothes ====

Just after midnight yesterday, Mliller met Anthony Rivak, 34, on the street and invited him to his home. When Rivak refused Miller shot him in the abdomen. Rivak, who is in critical condition, sent [olice to Miller's home.

There they found Steve F. Demko, 26, and Peter F. Pope, 17, both shot and bludgeoned to death. Miller was dead with the murder pistol near him.

Pope, who was wearing women's clothes, was at first identified as Albert French, of Philadelphia, but police said today that Pope had broken into French's car and stolen his identification papers. French is in the Air Force in Texas.
