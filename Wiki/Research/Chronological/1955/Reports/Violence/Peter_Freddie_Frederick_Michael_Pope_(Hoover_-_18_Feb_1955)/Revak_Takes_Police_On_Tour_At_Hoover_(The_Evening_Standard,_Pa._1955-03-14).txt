===== Revak Takes Police On Tour At Hoover =====

==== Masontown Man Retraces Route He Covered With Robert Miller On Night Of Murders ====

Discharged Saturday from Uniontown Hospital, Anthony Revak of Masontown led State POlice over the route he took with Robert Miller at Hoover Works, near McCleandtown, the night of Feb 19.

Police burst into the Miller home that night, to find five people dead in a horrible mass slaughter—Miller himself, apparently a suicide; his wife and daughter, and two young men.

Revak is not being held by police.

He told troopers that he and Miller walked toward Miller's home after alighting from a bus. He said that he took a circuitous route so that he wouldn't be seen.

Within a half-mile of the Miller home, Revak said, the two quarreled. He told police that sicks and stones were the weapons, until Miller fired at him.

Revak said that Miller seemed cool and collected, "He (Miller) displayed no emotion whatever," police quoted Revak as saying. "He insisted that I go to him home and when I resisted, he shot me."

The Masontown man is to return to the hospital in two weeks to to have the bullet extracted from his abdomen.
