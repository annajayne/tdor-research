Police said Demko and Pope had been beaten in the head, apparently with a machinists hammer found nearby. Demko also had been shot with a .25-caliber pistol. Miller was shot in the chest and his wrists had been slashed.

There was no evidence of a struggle. All window blinds were drawn when police arrived, doors were locked from the inside and fuses had been taken from, the main switch box.

"We haven't been able to question Rivak too much," State Police Sgt. H..J. Jaymes said. "His story is that Miller met him as he (Rivak) got off a bus last Saturday night and asked him to go to his home. He said he refused and that Miller fired several shots at him, then disappeared into the night."

Jaymes said that Miller was known as a "flashy dresser" although he had been unemployed recently and was receiving public assistance payments from the state.

Police said the Miller couple had another daughter, Mrs. Alex Golgoczy, 27, of Cleveland, Ohio.
