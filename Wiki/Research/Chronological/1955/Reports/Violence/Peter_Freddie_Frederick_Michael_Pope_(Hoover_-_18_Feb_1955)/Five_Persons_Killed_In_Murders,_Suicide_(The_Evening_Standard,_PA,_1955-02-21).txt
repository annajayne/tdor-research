===== FIVE PERSONS KILLED IN MURDERS, SUICIDE =====

===== Hoover Works Is Scene of Grisly Weekend Tragedy =====

==== 5th Victim Of Bloody Outbreak Identified Late This Morning As 17-Year-Old Duquesne Lad ====

 The fifth victim of the weekend's horror-filled outbreak of murder and suicide at Hoover Works was identified late this morning as Peter Frederick Michael Pope, 17, of Duquesne.

The identification was made at the Yoney Funeral Home in Masontown by his mother, Mrs. Zella Pope.

In one of the most grisly tragedies ever to occur in Fayette County, police said that over a four-day period Robert L. Miller. 42, of Hoover Works, near McClellandtown, killed his wife and daughter and men, shot a third man, and then committed suicide.

	The dead, in addition to Miller himself and Pope:
	Mrs. Helen Miller, 47.
	Doris Miller, 17.
	Steve Frank Demko, 24, a Korean War veteran, of Hoover Works. 

The man who was shot, Anthony Revak, 34,  of Fort Mason Village, Masontown, was;, still in Uniontown Hospital this morning, believed on the way to recovery.

Mrs. Pope, of 32 Earl St., Duquesne, came to the Yoney Funeral Home to identify the body of her son, in company with Capt. Edward Wisbar of the Duquesne Police Force.

Capt. Wisbar told The Evening Standard this morning that "arrangements had been made between Miller and Pope a week ago, for the boy to go Miller's home for dinner on Friday evening."

 Miller picked the youth up that night at his home in Duquesne and nothing had been heard from him since then.

It was reported that the arrangements for dinner were made with the idea that Pope would visit daughter, Doris. The two had met in Duquesne last summer, the report said.

The police theory is that the hideous outbreak related to sexual perversion in which Miller indulged. Neighbors and acquaintances told police that he was known to seek the company of men, and Revak said that Miller had "propositioned" him on Main St. in Uniontown Saturday.

Dist. Atty.-Fred L. Brothers said this morning was convinced the slaughter resulted from perversion and sadism.

The multiple murder came to light Saturday after Revak was brought to Uniontown Hospital with the gunshot wound.

But police believe that the killing started Wednesday.

In reconstructing the crimes, police believe that Miller killed his wife, bashing her head in with a hatchet, Wednesday night.

About 12 hours later, early Thursday, they think, he killed his daughter, again using the hatchet to smash her skull.

He hid their bodies under coal pile in Ihe basement. Some time Friday night or Saturday police believe, Demko and Pope were killed.

Demko's head also was "battered with a hatchet, while Pope was struck on the head with machinist's balpeen hammer.

=== Met Miller ===

Revak told police that he met Miller on Main St. in Uniontown about noon Saturday and that Miller offered him money to to a hotel room.

He refused and the men parted.

Late Saturday night, Revak took a bus from his home in Masontown to go to Hoover Works to see his parents. He said he walked about two miles from where he alighted from the bus in McClellandtown to Hoover.

Along the road about 200 yards from the Miller home, Revak said he met Miller and the latter shot at him, one bullet lodging in his side.

Revak made his way to a nearby tavern and was taken to hospilal by Charles Molnaro of McClellandtown. 

County Detective Frank B. Kane said he had questioned Revak again this morning and was "satisfied" with his story.

Police went to the Miller home about 2 a.m. and seeing a light and fearing a grim battle, waited for reinforcements.

About 4 a.m., they broke in.

In a downstairs, bedroom, they made the grisly discovery ol Miller lying In bed with a still-burning flashlight in his left hand and a .25 caliber automatic under his right hand. He

had slashed his writsts with a razor blade and blood welled from a bullet wound in his heart.

Beside him and partly under his body was the lifeless form of Demko, head battered and a shot also fired into his heart.

Both men were in their underclothes.

Millers body was still warm, police said, but Demoko's was cold.

Searching the house, police went upstairs and Trouper Anthony A. Cywinksi bulled back the covers from a neatly made bed—and discoverd the third body.

That was Pope's — his skull smashed and the pillow-case crimsoned.

It wasn't until Sunday afternoon, on further search, that officers found the fourth and fifth bodies — that of Mrs. Miller and her daugher — under the coal pile in the basement. The bodies were partly decomposed.

Dirt in another part of the basement had been freshly turned over, and the police searched through it, but no other bodies were discovered.

=== Neighbors Inquired ===

Neighbors had inquired after Mrs. Miller and the girl, and miller told them they had gone to Cleveland to visit a relative who was ill. He let a neighbor into the house of Friday and acted in a perfectly normal manner, it was reported.

The coal pile had been swept back neatly over the bodies of teh woman and girl, police said.

The windows in the downstairs of the house had been nailed shut. When the police broke in, they found that the fuses had been removed, and had to replace them before they could get electricity. Even then, the lights did not return in the two bedrooms where the bodies were discovered.

Demko, who lives a few houses down the street from the Millers, told his family on Wednesday that he was going to meet two men and go to Baltimore, Md. His car was found in a Uniontown garage—Demko hadn't been seen since then.

Identification of Pope was delayed when police found an identification card on him in the name of Albert J. French of Philadelphia. French, who is an airman at Sheppard Air Base in Texas, told officers a theif had broken into his home last summer and stolen his suitcase and papers.

Demko is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Demko of Hoover Works.

Investigating officers at the scene were County Detectives Kane and Tomas Hamilton, State Police Sgt. H. M. Jaynes, Cpl George McGloskey and Troopers Cynwisnki, Walter Geroda, William Gyurke and Jack Bingaman.

Mrs. Miller had a daughter by a previous marriage, Mrs. Alex Golgoczy, 27, of Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs. Golgoczy gave birth to her second child only last Friday night.

The dead woman's first husband was Paul Bootz, one off four brothers killed in the famous Mather mine disaster of the 1920s.
