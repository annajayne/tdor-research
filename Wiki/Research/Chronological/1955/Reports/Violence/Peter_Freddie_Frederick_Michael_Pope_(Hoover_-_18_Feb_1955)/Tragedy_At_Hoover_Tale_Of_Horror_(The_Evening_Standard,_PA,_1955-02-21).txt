===== Tragedy At Hoover Tale Of Horror =====

The bloody five-death tragedy at Hoover Works rivals in tis spine-chilling gruesomeness the "horror stories" of fiction.

Sgt. H. M. Jaynes and Cpl. George McCloskey of the state police agreed yesterday that it was among the most hideous cases they had ever run across.

County Detective Frank Kane said, "In all my police experience in Fayette COunty, it's the worst I've ever seen."

And beside the sheer horr of the crumpled, lifeless bodies...the spreading blood-stains...the hatchet and hammer and gun that were used to inflict the fatal injuries...there are questions to be answered.

Those questions are in the best 'detective-store' tradition.

==== Question of Motive ====

First, there is the question of motive.

answer may lie in sex perversion. Neighbors and acquaintances told officers that Bob Miller—former short-order cook, theater ticket-taker and steelworker—was a pervert who continually sought the company of men.

Anthony Revak, the Masontown man who Miller shot wild Saturday night, told state police—and has "stuck to the story"—that Miller "propositioned" him to go to a hotel room in Uniontown on Saturday, and that the shooting resulted from Miller's anger at the refusal. 

A neighbor told police thai men often visited Bob Miller and stayed for hours. Some pictures in the wallet of the man, found upstairs—mistakenly identified as French—were of men and they carried written remarks.

But does all this add up to reason and a cause for the days of horror at Hoover Works?

What made Miller go berserk? Why did he kill his wife and daughter? Those are questions that may never be answered.
