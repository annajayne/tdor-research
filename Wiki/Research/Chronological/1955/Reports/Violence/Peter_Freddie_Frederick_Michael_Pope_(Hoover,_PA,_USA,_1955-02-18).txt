High school student Freddie Pope, 17,  was one of four people killed at Hoover Works, near McClellandtown, Pennsylvania, by unemployed steelworker Robert L Miller, 42,  during a suicide-mass murder spree over four days from 16 Feb to 19 Feb, 1955.

Miller was well known by his neighbors for bringing men home and had been previously arrested, fined, and "run out of town" on Sep 19, 1954, in Duquesne, on a morals charge of attempting to induce a youth to his room.

Miller became enraged following a fight with his wife, Helen Miller, 47, where she threatened to leave and take her daughter to Cleveland. He killed her with a hatchet on Feb 16, 1955, and concealed her body in a coal bin. The next day he also killed their daughter, Doris (Dolores) Miller, 17, with the hatchet, and placed her body in the coal bin as well, covering both bodies in about 18 inches of coal.

On Feb 18 he killed Freddie Pope, who had previously been invited over for dinner that Friday, with a hammer and left the body in an upstairs bedroom of the home where it was later discovered partially clothed, dressed in women's clothing. 

On Feb 19 he used the hammer to beat Steve Frank Demko, 26, about the head and shot him, leaving the body in a downstairs bedroom where it was discovered partially clothed.

Around midnight of the same day, he attemped to induce Anthony Revak, 34, to enter the house for a 'sex date', but an argument and fight outside house ended with Miller shooting Revak in the abdomen but Revak fleeing to a nearby tavern where he sought assistance and summoned the police. Revak survived but required some weeks of hospitalization.

While Revak sought help, Miller reentered the house, slashed his wrists, shot and killed himself in the bed next to Demko's body.

The police entered the house a few hours after and found the bodies. 

The police initially believed that the body of Freddie Pope was that of Albert J. French of Philadelphia because his wallet was found with Pope's body. The wallet turned out to have been stolen about a year earlier from French's auto in Philadelphia. French was alive and was now an airman at Wichata Falls, TX. The police were clued into the identity of Pope when Freddie's mother, Zella Pope, reported to Duquesne police that they had left home Friday with Miller for the planned dinner and failed to return.
