===== Man in Woman's Clothes Is Slain =====
MT. CLEMENS, Mich., June 28—The body of a man dressed in woman's clothing, apparently slain and then trussed up to a tree on a lonely part of the Hillcrest Golf Course, a mile and a half from here, was found Thursday night, by two golfers making a last round before dark.

Deputy Sheriff Edwin Worm-bacher said that a mark on the right temple indicated that the man had been stunned, if not killed elsewhere and then dragged into a clump of underbrush near the Clinton River. A rope around the neck was attached to a small tree but the body was lying almost prone, its head held only a short distance off the ground, the deputy said.

The man was about 35 years old. He had been dead 8 or 10 days. Macomb County sent fingerprints to Detroit police seeking to identify him.
