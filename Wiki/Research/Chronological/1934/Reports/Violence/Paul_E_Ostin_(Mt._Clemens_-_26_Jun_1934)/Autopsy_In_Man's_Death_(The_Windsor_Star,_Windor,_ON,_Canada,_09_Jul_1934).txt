===== Autopsy In Man's Death =====

==== Body Dressed in Clothes of Woman Found June 28 ====

==== Detroit Worker ====

==== Is Exhumed From Potter's Field Grave For Enquiry ====

DETROIT, July 9.—An autopsy will be held today at the Wayne County morgue to determine the cause of the death of a man whose body, dressed in women's clothing, was found June 28 in a clump of bushes beside the Clinton river near Mt. Clemens.

=== OFFICIALS PERPLEXED ===

THE inquiry will be conducted by Macomb County officials, who are frankly perplexed by many phases of the case. Whether the victim was murdered or ended his own life provided the biggest mystery for investigators, but even the victim's identity has not been definitely established.

On Saturday, the body, which had been buried in a potter's field on orders of Macomb County Coroner John J. Stark without the formality of a post-mortem examination, was exhumed and tentatively identified as that of Paul Ostin, Detroit factory worker who disappeared June 26.

The exhumation was requested by Ostin s wife, Estelle, of 14661 Hazelridge avenue, and the identification was made by Ostin's brother, Carl, a police department construction worker who lives at 13338 Camden avenue.

=== SEVERAL THEORIES ===

Roy M. McKinstry, Macomb County prosecutor, explained that the autopsy would be held in Detroit because Mt. Clemens was not provided with adequate facilities.

"We have several theories about the case, and although none of them is founded on probability, we are inclined to believe that the victim ended his own life," McKinstry said.

"At present the identification is exceedingly uncertain," he continued. "Carl Ostin and several friends of Paul Ostin said that they thought that the scar tissue on the victim's right wrist was similar to the horseshoe-shaped scar on Ostin's wrist, but they weren't positive.

"Because Macomb County does not have the facilities for preserving bodies. Coroner Stark ordered the body buried without identification having been established or a post-mortem held. Apparently the man had been strangled. 

=== HAD BEEN ARRESTED ===

It also was disclosed yesterday that Ostin, a painter employed by the Chrysler Corporation, had been arrested by police June 8 for investigation in the theft of women's clothing. Because the complainant refused to prosecute, police said, Ostin was released after being held for 24 hours. He had no previous police record, they stated.

Fingerprints were to be taken today and compared with those of Ostin made at the time of his arrest, police said.

Ostin's disappearance was reported June 27 by his wife who told Detroit police that her husband had not been seen since 7.45 a.m. on the previous day. When he left her at Lafayette and Canton avenues he said he was going to the Stroh Brewing Co. to seek employment because he feared that he would be laid off work at the Chrysler.

He had never been in trouble before and was a hard-working father who provided the best he could for their two children, Robert, 12 years old, and Donald, 6, she said.

=== NO MOTIVE SEEN ===

Although no motive for either murder or suicide could be determined, Prosecutor McKinstry expressed the belief that the man expired where the body was found because of certain physical evidence found. The rope around the neck was loosely suspended from a tree nearby.

There were no signs of a struggle and no other wounds on the body, Sheriff George Smith reported.

In Ostin's automobile, which was found Friday afternoon only 200 feet from where the body was first discovered, Walter Kulka, an employee of the Macomb County Road Commission, found all of Ostin's clothing and 73 cents his wife reported him as having when he left her.

The machine, hidden in the thick underbrush, had not been noticed by the deputy sheriffs who first investigated the tragedy, but Kulka added to the perplexity of the case by insisting that Ostin's machine was not in the place where he found it at any time prior to its discovery there.

He regularly inspected the property at the rear of the Road Commission's warehouse where the car was found, he reported, but had not seen the car there until Friday, although the victim's body was found a short distance away ten days before by two Hamtramok boys.

The scene of the discovery is a heavily-overgrown field 100 yards from the river near the Hillcrest Golf Club.
