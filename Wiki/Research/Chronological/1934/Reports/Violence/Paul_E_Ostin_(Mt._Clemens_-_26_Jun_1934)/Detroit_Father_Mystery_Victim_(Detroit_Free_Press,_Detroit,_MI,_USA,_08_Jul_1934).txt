===== Detroit Father Mystery Victim =====

==== Missing Man's Body Is Identified ====

MT. CLEMENS. July 7—The body of a man found dressed in women's clothing, June 28, in a clump of bushes near here, and buried the next day, was exhumed Saturday and identified as that of Paul E. 0stin, Detroit factory worker, who disappeared June 26.

The exhumation was requested by Ostin's widow Estelle, after Ostln's car was found Friday within 200 feet of the spot whera the body was found.

In the car were found every article of clothing worn by Ostln when he vanished, together, with a pair of women's pajamas and a blue dress, the automobile keys, an opened package of cigarets, and 73 cents, the exact sum Mrs. Ostln said her husband had on his person the last time she saw him.

Identification was made by a brother, Carl Ostln, of 13338 Camden Ave., Detroit, an employee In the construction department of the Detroit Police force, who said that a scar on Ostin's arm was the same as one found on the disinterred corpse.

==== Autopsy to Be Held ====

The body was taken to Detroit Saturday afternoon for an autopsy. At the time of burial, death was declared to be due to strangulation. A rope was tied about the neck tightly, then tied without tension to a branch of a nearby tree. Officers said that the branch was too weak to have borne a man's weight.

The body was dressed in women's clothing, consisting of a white knitted hat, a green coat, a yellow slipover dress, a brassiere, three pairs of stepins, and three pairs of stockings. There were no shoes nor garters.

Ostin, who lived at 14661 Hazelridge Ave., Detroit, with his wife and two sons, Robert, 12 years old, and Donald, 6, took his wife to work on the morning of June 26, leaving her at the corner of Lafayette and Canton Ave.

==== Feared Loss of Job ====

He told her that he was afraid he was going to be laid off from his Job at the Chrysler factory, and that he intended to go to the Stroh Brewing Co. plant to inquire about a job. He did not return home, and "waa not seen thereafter. He was 36 years old.

Mrs. Ostin was mystified by the tragedy. She could offer no motive for the slaying. 

"I can't imagine why my husband disappeared," she said. He was a very trustful man. He never had any trouble or affairs with other women. He worked very hard and did the best he could.

==== Says He Had No Enemies ====

"He didn't have any enemies that I know of, and unless he picked up one of those bad characters around Lafayette and Canton Aves., I haven't any idea who might have killed him."

Mrs. Ostln could not explain what characters her husband might have met in the neighborhood after he left her, adding that

==== Body Is Identified by His Brother ====

she thought only that her husband might have given a ride to a stranger. 

"My husband didn't have any money with him either," and so I don't think robbery could have been a motive," she said. "All he had was about a dollar. Maybe his death was accidental. But police think he waa killed. I don't know.

"He left some insurance, hut very little. I knew he was afraid he might lose his Job but I'm sure he didn't end his life for what insurance we might get."

She could not explain the puzzling circumstance of the woman's attire In which her husband's body was clothed when found, 

"They weren't my clothes." she said. "They were just a bunch of old rags. Somebody probably threw them in the car."

A baffling angle which authorities here are investigating is the fact that Ostin's car was not seen at the place where it was later found at the time his body was discovered, not more than 200 feet distant.

 The site is near the warehouse of the Macomb County Road Commission, and the car was first seen there Thursday by Walter Kulka, an employee. He thought nothing of it at first, but reported it to Sheriff George T. Smith on Friday.

Friday afternoon the car and clothing in it were identified as Ostin's, and Saturday afternoon Mrs. Ostin requested that an exhumation be made. Coroner John J. Stark Immediately went out with Carl Ostin and made the disinterment.

Mrs. Ostin could not identify the women's clothing found in her husband's car, though the other articles were undoubtedly his, she said.

Macomb authorities doubted Saturday, as they had at the time the body was found, that Ostin had killed himself. But they could supply no possible theory for his slaying, nor for his being dressed in such a bizarre fashion.
