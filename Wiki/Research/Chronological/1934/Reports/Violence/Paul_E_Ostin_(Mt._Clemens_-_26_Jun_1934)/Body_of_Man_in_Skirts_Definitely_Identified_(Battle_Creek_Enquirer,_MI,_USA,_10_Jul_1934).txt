Detroit. July 10.—(AP)—The body of a man clad in women's clothing, which was found near Mt. Clemens June 28 and was buried without identification, was identified definitely Monday as that of Paul Ostin, Detroit factory worker, who was reported missing June 26 by his wife.

Identification was made by fingerprints taken from the body and compared with prints taken from Ostin when he was arrested June 8 by police who charged him with stealing women's clothing from a clothes line. He could not be identified in this theft, police said, and was released.
