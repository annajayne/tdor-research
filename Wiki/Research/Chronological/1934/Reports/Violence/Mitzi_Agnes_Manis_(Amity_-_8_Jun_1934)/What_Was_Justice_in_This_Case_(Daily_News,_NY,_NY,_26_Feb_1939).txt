===== WHAT WAS JUSTICE IN THIS CASE? =====

==== Mystery of the Slain Female Impersonator ====

=== **By PETER LEVINS** ===

{{.\mitzi manis-2.PNG}}

TWO farm hands made the discovery, June 15, 1934, while they were plowing a field on the farm of Ray Conger, ten miles from Washington, Pa. John Pavlowich was riding the rose and Roy McDonough was guiding the plough.

They had reached the end of a row, and Pavlowich had gotten down to stretch his legs, when he saw a leg protruding from behind a clumb of elderberry bushes. He assumed it was some stranger taking a nap on this ideal Summer day. But when he advanced he saw it was the body of a young man, partially concealed by a layer of boards.

Presently the remains were removed to the morgue in Washington. Coronoer William B. Baker estimated that death had occured about a week before. The autopsy showed later the the young man had died of a broken neck. Except for a few small bruises there were no other signs of violence.

Nor was there any trace of poison in the body.

==== Victim Not a Student, University Reports. ====

Nothing of an identifying nature was found on the victim. The police believed at first that he was one of the students of Washington and Jefferson University, which was situated in the town.

//However, a telephone call to the office of the president, Dr. Ralph C. Hutchinson, brought back prompt word that, to the best of their knowledge, every one of the several hundred undergraduates was accounted for.//

As a matter of fact, graduation exercises had taken place almost a week earlier. The lower classmen had left several days before the commencement.

President Hutchison added that the university authorities would be glad to co-operate if the police found any evidence to indicate that the victim had been one of the students.

Neither Washington nor neighboring Pittsburgh had a record of a missing youth. Nevertheless, a description was circulated through both communities in the hope of finding some one who could identify him.

The description stated that the victim was slim, blonde, smooth-faced, had wavy brown hair and good teeth. He was wearing a blue serge suit.

//Among the other who came to view the body was Chief of Country Detectives W. B. Dinsmore, who remarked, "That lad looks familiar to me. I suggest you call up the Rhythm Club at Sawmill Run Boulevard in Pittsburg. I have an idea this is one of their 'girls.'"//

The call was made—and the night club said at once that their leading mand, George Manis, had not reported for work since June 8.

"Why wasn't he reported missing?" the police wanted to know.

It developed, through questioning of Elsie Eckert, check room girl at the club, and members of the chorus, that on the evening of the 7th, a Thursday, Manis had bragged he was going to take a week off at Atlantic City, N. J.

"And what'll you use for money?"

//Manis, known familiarlly as Mitzi, had answered, with a snap of his fingers, "I can raise two hundred like that."//

His fellow-workers had taken it for granted that he was hinting at blackmail. They'd heard rumors that his outside activities were bringing him enough extra cash to keep up a small but luxurious apartment on Craft Ave.

Therefore his absence from the night club had caused no concern. They assumed he had gotten that two hundred and taken the next train out.

Who, then, had he approached? That became the next big question in the minds of the authorities.

But it happened that Mitzi had known quite a number of possible candidates for blackmail. So many names were mentioned that the investigators forsaw a long and difficult search. The club's "leading lady" had been a very attractive fellow indeed.

//He had been the torch singer of the resort, wearing a dazzling gown that revealed his powdered shoulders, and a wig of dainty curls. A chorus of other female impersonators had minced around him during his numbers. But Mitzi had far outshone the others//.

DETECTIVES hastened to his apartment in the hope of finding some clue to the victim's companion on the fatal night.

The apartment, they observed, was appropriately effeminate, satiny sofa cushions lending the proper touch. The officers found several letters, though not of recent date, which mentioned a number of citizens. These citizens all furnished unbreakable alibis.

Had any one seen Manis the night of June 8, the newspapers asked. If so, had he been with some one or had he been along?

//Vague replies filtered in. The victim's acquaintance had been rather limited. However, two persons agreed that they had seen him in the vicinity of Washington and Jefferson University, near the dormitories, on the afternoon of the 8th. He had been alone.//

The search veered back to the field in which the body had been found. Officers had already gone over the scne, and footprints had long since disappeared. But now the detectives decided to make a more extned search, covering the field as far as the road, and back for some hundred yards.

One piece of possible evidence was found—a spectacle case.

This contained an expensive pair of bi-focals. On the inside of the lid was a narrow, oblong plate bearing the name of the oculist-optician who had made out the prescription and ground the lenses. The name, Dr. C. E. Tibbens, was weel known in both Pittsburgh and Washington.

A detective hastened to Dr. Tibbens.

"Can you identify these, Doctor?"

The optician peered at the lenses and finally nodded. "I think I can," he said. "Just a minute."

//He turned to his records. "Yes," he continued, nodding again. "Those lenses took a lot of grinding. I couldn't forget them. They belong to George Bartholomew. You know—wresting coach at the university. Fine fellow."//

Every one knew "Bart." He'd been wrestling coach at the school for twelve years. Active in Boy Scout affairs. Athletic adviser to incoming freshment. One of the most popular men in college circles.

And these were his glasses...

SOMETHING wrong somewhere, the detectives agreed. Bart couldn't be mixed up in a thing like this. Must have lost his glasses while out with his family. He had a fine wife, the recalled, and three splendid children—Rovert 16; Jean, 17, and George, 18.

A telephone call to the Bartholomew home showed that the family had gone away for the week-end. A maid reported that they were expected back about midnight.

Two detectives were waiting when the car drove up to the house on North Collge Ave. The officers made no move to stop Mrs. Barthoomew or the children. But they had a few quiet words with the 49-year-old suspect.

"What do you want?" he asked.

"We'll have to ask you a few questions?"

He nodded. "Very well." Then he turned to his wife. "Don't wait up for me, Helen, I've got to go into Pittsburgh. Don't worry."

A fwe minutes later they were showing him the spectacle case. "Yours?" they inquired.

Bartholomew examined the case quite calmly.

//"Where did you find it?" he asked. "I went back to the field and hunted for the case. You had better luck than I."//

He readily admitted that he had been with Manis that June night he had last been seen alive.

"I met him for the first time on the night of the 6th," he said, then added, "Id rather not being in any onther names."

Manis, he said, had appeared at him home of the vening of the 7th and asked for a loan. Bartholomew, greately surprised at this request, graciously but firmly refused it. Manis had argued a little, then left.

But on the following day he had returned. This time, according to the coach, he had resolted to threats.

//"He told me," Bartholomew continued, "that he was going to see Dr. Hutchinson and 'make up a story that will ruin you and your family and discgrace the college.'"//

The female impersonator's voice took on a shirll, hysterical note. Bartholomew became somewhat panic-striken. It seemd that every open window must have an eager pair of ears behind it.

Outside in the strett were young students, exchanging their farewells until the Fall. What if they caught snatches of this creature's foul mouthings?

ACCORDING to Bartholomew's story, he resolved to get Manis out of and away from the house. It seem the only thing to do under the circumstances. Had he thrown the fellow out, Manis probably would have filled the night with screaming accusations. After all, the coach had aposition and a reputation to consider.

"Let's go out to my car," Bartholomew suggested. "We can talk better away from here."

Mitzi smirked and agreed.

==== Discussion Develops Into a Brawl ====

Bartholomew said that he tried to reason with the young man, point out that his salary was small, that he had a wife and three children to support, that it would be very difficult for him to put his hands on two hundred dollars.

But Manis would not listen to reason. Bartholomew said that what had started as a peaceful discussion developed into a brawl.

"We began to fight in the car. The door fell open and we both tumbled down a hill. Manis got to his feet first and dashed across a field, screaming at the top of his voice."

"I ran after him to shut him up. We both fell into a post hole near the fence. He fell on top of me and hit me in the chest."

The prisoner was asked what he did then. Again he answered without hesitation. At no time did he ever attempt to evade the issue.

//"I struck him three times im the jaw with my fist," he replied.//

"Did you put a strangle hold on him? That would account for the broken neck."

But the wrestling coach shook his head. "No. I only hit him on the jaw and he went limp."

That was his story.

					   *                *                *

Now the police began to look into Bartholomew's life and character—and if ever a good reputation was to prove its value, it did in this case. Whereever the detectives inquired they heard only good of him. Not a whisper of evil had ever been spoken about him in connection with his contact with students—or any one else.

Manis' attemt at blackmail had been complete without justification, it was said. The accused man's friends insisted he had been the victim of a most unlucky

break. No one could recall having seen Bartholomew and Manis together prior to June 6.

"That pansy," said the friends, "picked on Bart because he knew that how much any notoriety would embarrass him."

When it came to investigating the dead youth's past, the detectives gathered quite a different reaction.

Mitzi, also known as Agnes, had come of respectable parents and had received a fairly good education. When jobs became hard to find, during the depression, he had drifted into Pittsburgh night life. At the Rhythem Club, the town's most notorious resort, he

had found his level as a singing female impersonator.

The club had prospered, but after several months its shows became so shocking to the authorities that, after a raid, certain numbers had to be modified.

//With the wrestling coach in custody, all Washington and Pittsburg wanted to know just what President Hutchison would do in the matter. Word had leaked out that Mrs. Bartholomew was leaving town on Hutchison's advice—she was going, as had been originally planned to the family's camp in Wisconsin.//

Would the president stand by this member of his staff?

==== Lawyers Retained By Unnamed Source. ====

"The college has nothing to do with the case?" he flatly told the reporters.

Nevertheless, they learned that Robert Burnside, president of the Washington County Bar Association, and Russel Z. Moniger had been retained as Bartholomew's counsel — retained by some one whose identity the reporters could not discover.

					   *                *                *

TRAIL was set for late August.

Meanwhile the air was filled with speculations. Would the defense bring into court the men who had known the slain entertainer? Would the defense use them on the witness stand to prove that Manis had made a living by blackmail?

But no hint of the defense plans leaded out nor was President Hutchison ever heard to express any interest in the fate of the defendant.

//Nevertheless, it seemed obvious that if Bartholomew talked the college would automatically be incolved. Therefore many believed that Hutchison would be doing his best to save the institution any unpleasant notoriety.//

Came the trial. The courtroom was jammed with expectant spectators.

But they were to be disappointed. There would be no lurid trial. George Manis' secret friends were not to be revealed. The university was not to be involved.

George Bartholomew pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. No witnesses were to be called. The subject of blackmail was not mentioned. In one brief session, Justice put the lid of silence on this case.

He received a sentence on Aug. 24 of 3 to 6 years in the Western Penitentiary, Pittsburgh. During his term he was a model prisoner, spending most of his time at the prison farm, Rockview, Pa. At the time of his release in August 1937, he was working in the prison cannery.

Is he back at the university? Apparently not. The report from Pittsburgh says, "Whereabouts and present actvities unknown."
