===== Charge Wrestling Coach With Slaying Female Impersonator =====

Washington, Pa.—(Special) A pair of spectacles constitute the telltale evidence that has resulted in the arrest of George Bartholomew, 49-year-old Washington and Jefferson college wrestling coach, charged with the slaying on the night of June 8 of George Manis, 23, female impersonator.

The murder, according to charges preferred, was committed in a cornfield twelve miles from here. The spectacles were found near the body, which had been buried in the field. Because they were of a distinctive kind and because of the good memory of the optician who made them, it was possible for county authorities to trace the owner.

This case is similar to the Leopold-Loeb case in Chicago ten years ago. Nathan Leopold dropped his glasses near a culvert in which the body of Bobby Franks whom he and Richard Loeb had slain was hidden. Ownership of the glasses was traced to Leopold, resulting in admissions which led to the arrest of tne siay ers who are now confined to the Illinois state prison for their crime.

Sensational disclosures following the arrest of the college coach have shocked this sedate community.

==== Third Violent Death ====

The death of Manis is the third violent death to occur here in recent years.

Two months ago, Thomas W. Smith, a Pittsburgh oil company executive, was fatallv injured when he was ejected from a hotel by Charles Goldner, a freshman foot ball star.

Six years ago, Miss Thelma Morgan, college employee, was murdered near the college campus. Her head had been crushed with a brick which lay beside the body when it was found.

Bartholomew is alleged to have told authorities that he had accidentally killed Manis after the latter had threatened him with a blackmail plot. He said Manis begged him for $200, and when it was refused, the effeminate young man told him that, unless he produced the money, he would make up a story to tell to the college president that would disgrace the reputation of the wrestling coach and members of his family.

==== Go For Ride ====

The alleged slayer said he agreed to go for a ride with Manis. After they were out in the country about twelve miles, they started fighting in the automobile, he said. The car door came open and they both rolled down a twenty-foot embankment, after which Manis got up and started running into the cornfield.

Manis screamed as he ran, according to Bartholomew, and the coach ran to stop him from screaming. He was quoted as saying" that he and Manis fell into a hole, Manis falling on top of Bartholomew. He said he became enraged and pummeled the female impersonator with his fists. After killing Manis, Bartholomew became frightened and buried him in the cornfield. Workmen on the farm discovered the body the following day.

Examination of the body revealed Manis' neck was broken. Authority accused Bartholomew of having placed a strangle hold on his victim, but he denied it. The body showed bruises resulting from the pounding.

Bartholomew said after he had left the scene of the killing, he missed his glasses, and went back to look for them. He thought they dropped out of his pocket when he and Manis fell out of the car, but was mistaken. They dropped beside Manis' body while Bartholomew was burying It.

Manis was known In Pittsburgh night clubs as "Mitzi." Costumed in an evening gown, he entertained as a "torch" singer in several night clubs and other places.
