===== JUSTICE SETS A RECORD =====

TRAFFIC courts, in which justice is ground out in speedy and informal manner—a case a minute will have to look to their laurels.

For Washington County has established a record in handling a murder case which rivals the way in which a charge of overparking or making an illegal turn is handled by most other courts.

When it comes to complete co-ordination of all agencies of the law, in order that a maximum of speed and silence may be secured the judicial machinery of our neighboring county does a job that should make the auto manufacturers green with envy. For justice was certainly traveling at a dizzy clip when it handled the case of George H. Bartholomew, the college athletic director, who killed a youthful female impersonator on June 8.

The blind goddes with the scales must have certainly had one eye open as she whizzed around the corner to establish a record which has been seldom been equaled even in a trial for vagrancy or peddling without a license. Murder is reduced to the status of a misdemeanor and the value of a human life scarcly attains the dignity of petty larceny under such conditions.

ALTHOUGH George H. Bartholomew killed Thomas Manis on June 8—hiding the body undedr boards and bushes in a field in which it was discovered several days later—the Coroner's inquest was not held until Friday.

The Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of murder.

And then developed the amazing triple pass which ended with a short sentence for Bartholomew.

From the Coroner's Jury the case was passed to the Grand Jury, which promptly returned a murder indictment.

From the Grand Jury it was passed to the Court of Judge Howard Hughess, where Bartholomew immediately pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter (although the indictment was for murder) and was sentenced to from three to six years in the penitentiary, without the hearing of any testimony to determine the facts.

Less than two hours afer the inquest sentence had been passed.

We suggest this case to the Pennsylvania State Bar Association as an interesting topic for discussion at its next convention. For new records are always worth studying.
