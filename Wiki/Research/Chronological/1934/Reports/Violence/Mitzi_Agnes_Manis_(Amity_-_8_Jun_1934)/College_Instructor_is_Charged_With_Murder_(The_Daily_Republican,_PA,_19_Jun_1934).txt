===== COLLEGE INSTRUCTOR IS CHARGED WITH MURDER IN DEATH OF YOUTH =====

==== Parents of Dead Impersonator Ridicule 'Blackmail' Accusation, Demand Prosecution ====

Washington, Pa.. June 19—(INS)—) George II. Bartholomew, director of physical education at Washington and Jefferson College here, today was formally charged with the murder of George T, Manis, 23, popular female impersonator.

An information charging the 48-year-old director with the youth's death was sworn to before Alderman John Carmichael. 

Manis' body was found Saturday beneath a pile of brush and stone near Amity. Bartholomew admitted in a statement signed yesterday that he engaged in a fatal light with the night-club entertainer, according to District Attorney Warren S. Burchinal. 

Washington, Pa., June 19— (INS) -Held on an open charge in connection with the death of 23-year-old George T. Manis, Washington actor, George H. Bartholomew, 48, director of physical education at Washington & Jefferson college, awoke after a restless night in his county jail cell today. 

Declaring that Bartholomew admitted Manis "went limp" while the two engaged in a scuffle, District Attorney Warren S. Burchinal was expected to file formal charges against the college instructor today. A pair of eye glasses found near Manis' decomposed body in a field near Amity led to the arrest of Bartholomew who also is wrestling coach at W. &  J. 

Bartholomew, according to Burchinal, claims the fight and subsequent death of the youth, a well-known female impersonator in the tri-state area, followed several attempts on his part to "blackmail" the physical director. Despite the youth's insistence that he be given money. Bartholomew never complied with the requests, police said they were informed.

Grief-stricken and shocked by the discovery of their son's lifeless body Saturday, Manis' parents scoffed at the blackmail motive. His father, A. L. Manis, called the motive ridiculous.

"George loved a good time—the brigt lights and night club life, but he was never a spendthrift," the father remarked. "We gave him all the money he needed."

His mother sobbed:
"I know my body too well. It couldn't have been blackmail."

Meanwhile, the dead youth's father swore to presss charges against Bartholomew.

"I think electrocution would be too quick for Bartholomew," he observed. "I'm going to fight to the end for George."

The fatal fight between Manis and Bartholomew occured on the night of June 8, police said. In a signed statement, Bartholomew admitted requesting the youth to get into his car on that night following a demand for money. While driving, the quarreled and suddenly Bartholomew brought his car to a halt. During an ensuing scuffle, the car door opened pitching both men to the ground and down an embankment.

During another scuffle which followed shortly, Bartholomew told county detectives that Manis' body suddenly "went limp" and dropped to the field. Upon examination Bartholomew stated he discovered the youth had died.

An autopsy discolsed the young Manis' neck was broken although Bartholomew denied any knowledge that the actor had sustained such an injury.

The sight of the dead youth lying in the field caused him to become panic-stricken, Bartholomew said, so he covered the body with boards and branches from trees.

Bartholomew, a remarkably active and powerful man, has been in Washington since 1922. An autopsy fixed the cause of Manis' death as a broken neck but it was not stated how it had occured. A blow on the chin could have snapped the vertebra as could a wresting hold, taken instictly by Bartholomew as he grappled with the youth who was frail and of little physical strength.

Bartholomew, to all appearances, led the life of a normal married man with his wife and three children. Stunned by the tragedy, his family left yesterday for a quiet retreat.

Private funderal services were held yesterday afternoon in a Washington mortuary for the dead youth. Burial took place in the Washington cemetery.

The arrest of Bartholomew came as a stunning surprise to residents of the county seat. He was taken into custody quietly late Sunday-night upon his return from a day in the mountains with members of his family. Questioned by County Detectives William B. Dinsmore and Frank Creps until early yesterday morning, he issued his statement.

Eye glasses which were found in the vicinity of the spot where the body was discovered by Roy McDonough, who was plowing corn on the David O. Conger farm, near Conger Station, led to Bartholomew's arrest. Isued by a Washington physician, the name of the purchaser was secured from him.
