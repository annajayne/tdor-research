===== ACTOR'S BODY FOUND UNDER BRUSH PILE =====

==== Washington County Police Believe Youth Was Murdered ====

WASHINGTON. Pa., June 16—A body found beneath a brush pile in Morris Township near here early today was identified by A. L. Manis, 16 East Wheeling Street, as that of his son, George T. Manis, missing since June 8.

Identification was made by the clothing. Police are working on the theory that he had been killed and the body concealed to hide the crime. Manis was a theatrical performer and was well known in Pittsburgh and Atlantic City.
