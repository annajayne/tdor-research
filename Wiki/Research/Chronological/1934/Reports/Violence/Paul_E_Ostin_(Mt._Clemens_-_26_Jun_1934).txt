On June 28th, 1934, the body of Paul E Ostin, 36 years-old, dressed in woman's clothing, was found by two golfers, hidden in some brush near the Clinton River, on the Hillcrest Golf Course near Mt. Clemens, Michigan, USA.

The body had no identification and was found with a rope tied tightly around its neck and tied without tension to branch on a tree that was too small to support a body. The rope was long enough that the body was laying nearly prone, with the head resting only a short distance off the ground. Police noted a head injury and speculated that the man had been stunned or perhaps killed elsewhere and then the body dragged into the bushes. The death was estimated to have occured 8 to 10 days earlier.

Without a post-mortem examination being performed, or identification, the body was buried in the Potter's Field the next day. Fingerprints were sent to the Detroit police seeking to identify the corpse.

On 6 July, Ostin's automobile was found about 200 feet from the location of the body by an employee of the Macomb County Road Commission. This was quickly linked to the owner and a missing person's report for Paul Ostin filed by their wife on 27 June. The car contained the clothes Ostin had last been seen in, automobile keys, a pair of women's pyjamas, a blue dress, an opened package of cigarets, and 73 cents. A peculiarity was found in that employee stated that he inspected the area regularly and that the automobile had NOT been there until it was discovered on 6 July.

Thes body was exhumed on 7 July and identified by Ostin's brother. It was sent to Detroit for a full autopsy. A fingerprint match was made to an arrest made on 8 June in a case where Ostin had been arrested, but not prosecuted, for stealing women's clothing from a clothes line. He could not be identified in the theft and had been released.

Paul Ostin was buried again on 12 July 1934.
