{{.\Mitzi Manis Profile Picture.jpg?width=276}}

The body of 23 year-old female impersonator Mitzi Manis was discovered hidden beneath some brush and stones in a field on the David O. Conger farm, near Conger Station, Amity, Pennsylvania on 15 June 1934. Mitzi had last been seen alive on the 8th of June.  Mitzi was the top performer at the  Rhythm Club at Sawmill Run Boulevard in Pittsburg.

Mitzi had been the torch singer of the resort, wearing a dazzling gown that revealed powdered shoulders, and a wig of dainty curls. A chorus of other female impersonators had minced around Mitzi during their numbers. But Mitzi had far outshone the others and had a subtantial following of admirers who supplied Mitzi enough extra cash to keep up a small but luxurious apartment on Craft Ave. The apartment, police observed, was appropriately effeminate, with satiny sofa cushions lending the proper touch. The officers found several letters, though not of recent date, which mentioned a number of citizens. These citizens all furnished unbreakable alibis.

However, within days the police traced an expensive pair of glasses found near the body to George Bartholomew, a 49-year-old Washington and Jefferson college wrestling coach. 

Bartholomew is alleged to have told authorities that he had accidentally killed Manis after the latter had threatened him with a blackmail plot. He said Manis begged him for $200, and when it was refused, the effeminate young man told him that, unless he produced the money, he would make up a story to tell to the college president that would disgrace the reputation of the wrestling coach and members of his family.

In a signed statement, Bartholomew admitted requesting the youth to get into his car on that night following a demand for money. This was in an effort to get Manis away from where other people might overhear their conversation. While driving, they quarreled and suddenly Bartholomew brought his car to a halt. During an ensuing scuffle, the car door opened and they both rolled down a twenty-foot embankment, after which Manis got up and started running into the cornfield.

Manis screamed as he ran, according to Bartholomew, and the coach ran to stop him from screaming. He was quoted as saying" that he and Manis fell into a hole, Manis falling on top of Bartholomew. He said he became enraged and pummeled the female impersonator with his fists. After killing Manis, Bartholomew became frightened and buried him in the cornfield.

Examination of the body revealed Manis' neck was broken. Authority accused Bartholomew of having placed a strangle hold on his victim, but he denied it. The body showed bruises resulting from the pounding.

The sight of the dead youth lying in the field caused him to become panic-stricken, Bartholomew said, so he covered the body with boards and branches from trees.

At trial, on August 24, 1934, George H. Bartholomew pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter and received a sentence of 3 to 6 years in the Western Penitentiary, Pittsburgh. He was released from prison in August, 1937.
