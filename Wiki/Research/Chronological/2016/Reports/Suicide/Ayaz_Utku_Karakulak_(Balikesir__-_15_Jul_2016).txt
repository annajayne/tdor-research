> 
> Media outlets used Ayaz's identity while reporting his suicide. While Twitter users put pressure on media outlets for transphobia with the hashtag #AyazUtkuKarakulak, hate messages were sent to Ayaz Utku's girlfriend.
> 
> His girlfriend wrote on Twitter: "My girlfriend of 6 years did not deserve to die just because she is trans." You couldn't fit only my lover into that huge world. Fuck your judgments that didn't even allow me to go to his funeral! I have no forgiveness for anyone. He had a fear of heights, so he threw himself from a height. Who knows how you hurt him... My 6 years, my dear. Rest easy!” shared his message.
> 
> Rest in peace. We wish patience to all his fans.
