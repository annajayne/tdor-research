> 
> The days have been hard.
> Each day greets us with this realization. Our  world is emptier without you.
> 
> We see you and hear you in so many things that we do. There are so many days that have you written all over it. 
> 
> Our heavy hearts lighten when we think of your smile, how you enter a room, a silly song, a dance, a joke you told, your eye roll and hearing you say “ugh”, “pfft” and giggle over a “lame” thing that we do, we miss your random interjections of “moo”, “merp, “blep”, “meh”, “bloop”, “squoosh”, in conversations. etc. Everything reminds us of you and it hurts. You should be here.
> 
> There are moments, for just a split second, we forget and then it hits us like a ton of bricks. We feel a stab in our hearts, so deep and painful, that we cannot face the fact that you are gone.
> 
> The world is a much darker colder place without you. We find bits of solace in your rainbow of memories you left with us and others.
> 
> We love you and we will miss you forever.

> by L.A. Ochoa
> 
> I have been tossed in an ocean
> Surrounded by a feeling
> Treading water, but only enough
> to keep myself from giving up
> 
> I'm numb from trying so hard
> A fire burning in my chest
> And I can only hope that someone
> Hears me in this silence
> 
> And when the ocean is calm
> It overwhelms me
> And when the storms come
> They drown me
> 
> And still I find myself clinging onto you
> 
> 'Cause the ocean, it may have taken you
> And flooded the world with sorrow
> Your memories are an island
> And I am washed back to shore
> 
> And the waves, they batter me
> And the storms still rage overhead
> I have found myself on firm ground
> Because of you
> 
> And on your shore, we will build castles
> And on your shore, we will find shells and pebbles
> And on your shore, we will be calling out to you
> 
> And as the ocean washes away the castles
> The crashing of the waves drowns out our voices
> The ocean brings us treasures
> The memories of you
> 
> * * * * *

> A memorial service will be held in the coming months
