> "Sam", 15. 20th October 2020. Suicide. No image. Sam is an alias used in a Child Safeguarding Practice Review. Sam was referred to GIDs in June 2017 but had to wait 22 months for the first appointment. During wait period Sam had multiple hospital visits for self harm.
> 
> Sam was seen by GIDS in July 2019, & they were due to "complete a report towards the end of 2020, before which Sam unfortunately died". "it was a cause of distress to Sam where agencies failed to correctly identify & refer to his gender identity".
> 
> "A notable exception" was a CAMHS support worker who "was always correct and sensitive in their interactions with Sam". The safeguarding report identified "no clear & coherent multi-agency risk assessment undertaken which was understood by all the agencies involved."
> 
> Sam’s dad felt "each agency blamed the other but did not offer any solutions or real support". In particularly GIDS was not involved to crucial meetings which meant "They were unaware of the level of self-harm Sam was undertaking until October 2020".
> 
> GIDS were finally invited to an AMBIT meeting in October 2020 at time of Sam’s last admission to hospital. "Sam was due to hear shortly before his death that GIDS considered that he was not eligible for consideration of any physical interventions." (Referral to Endocrinology).

During the 22 month wait, GIDS provided no support to Sam. "it was left for CAMHS to manage Sam’s gender identity...Once the service started to work with Sam CAMHS made a number of requests to GIDS for care & risk management plans but these were never received". 

"Sam avoided contact with his GP as on their records Sam was referred to as his natal gender and was referred to as his female name". When he did eventually vist the GP due to serious need "The GP was unable to prescribe medication as Sam was under the care of CAMHS.

Because Sam was unable to maintain school attendance, was using drugs & was perceived to lack parental support [for blockers] "Sam was due to hear shortly before his death that GIDS considered that he was not eligible for consideration of any physical interventions".

"This news would have been likely to have impacted significantly on Sam & increased his instability. There's no indication that Sam was aware of this decision prior to his death". Sam Died Waiting For Care #DWFC
