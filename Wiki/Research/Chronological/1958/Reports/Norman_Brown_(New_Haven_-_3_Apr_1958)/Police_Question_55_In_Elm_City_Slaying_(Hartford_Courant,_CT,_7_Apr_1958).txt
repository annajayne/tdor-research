===== Police Question 55 In Elm City Slaying =====

NEW HAVEN (AP)—Police Sunday increased to 55 the number of people questioned in the strangulation-stabbing death of Norman Brown.

An autopsy showed the 29-year-old print shop worker died Thursday night as a result of both the stabbing and the strangulation.

No prime suspects were known Sunday night.

The body of Brown, a reported female impersonator, was discovered Friday by friends. A police detective called the slaying "a crime of passion."

He was stabbed in the abdomen with a large carving knife, and a sheet was knotted around his neck. Police said they found two albums of pictures showing Brown dressed in women s clothing.
