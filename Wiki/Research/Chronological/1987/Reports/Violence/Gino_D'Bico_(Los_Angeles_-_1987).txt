> As has been mentioned before in this same space, it is important to know the personalities who paved the way for the Mexican LGBT+ community to move forward with a more advanced level of freedom today. The road is still long, but as the saying goes: “people who do not know their history are destined to repeat their mistakes . ” It is for this and other reasons that this space seeks to rescue and compile many stories, places and people who helped open the path that the community has traveled, with tugs and pulls over the years. And in this #RostrosLGBT + space, it is time to pay tribute to a woman who walked through the dawn of Mexican sexual freedom. Her name was Gina D'Bico and this is her story.
> 
> Before starting, it is important to highlight that gathering details about Gina's life and work has been a tremendous and meticulous task due to the scarce information available in the media. As also happened with the article dedicated to Mónica Alejandra "Naná" in this same space, it seems as if time had devoured them. However, what can be rescued about her life is captured in this space with the greatest dedication and coherence possible.
> 
> Who was Gina D'Bico? Well, Gina (short for Georgina) was a beautiful woman who burst onto the scene in Mexico 's social and nightlife back in the early 1970s. And what's so extraordinary about that, many will ask? Well, Gina was a trans woman. In fact, she is one of the first trans personalities to openly burst onto the Mexican social scene.
> 
> According to the testimonies of her contemporaries, Gina's beauty was breathtaking. Actress, showgirl and visual artist Terry Holiday (one of her closest friends) describes her like this:
> 
> She was originally from Mexico City . The first testimonies place Gina wandering around the Zona Rosa of the Mexican capital in the early 1970s. According to calculations based on testimonies, Gina must have been born around 1957 or 1958. She was so beautiful and had such a striking personality that she became a role model (a mother, one would say today) for other trans girls of the time. The most famous is Monica Alejandra "Nana" . "Nana" molded herself in the image and likeness of Gina D'Bico. Terry Holiday remembers that when she and Gina were already hanging out in nightclubs and parties like queens, "Nana" would watch them, still as a teenager, in a high school uniform. 
> 
> Gina shined in society, but also in the world of entertainment. She is the first trans woman to break into Mexican television (although unfortunately at that time the details were not documented). And Gina made a special appearance in the Televisa sitcom " Hogar, dulce hogar" (1974-1984). In the theater she debuted in the production "Lucrecia Borgia" by Alejandro Jodorowsky and performed at the Teatro Lírico . With Jodorowsky's help, she also made a cameo in the cult film "La montaña sagrada" (The Holy Mountain) (1971). Eventually she appeared in films such as "La vida difícil de una mujer fácil" by José María Fernández Unsáin , and "Cuando tejen las arañas" by Roberto Gavaldón , both in 1979.
> 
> There are some wonderful anecdotes that stem from Gina's beauty and personality. During rehearsals for the play "Lucrecia Borgia" , it is said that Gina's beauty (who appeared half-naked on stage) intimidated even Irma Serrano "La Tigresa" . Gina was also set to appear in the film "Noches de cabaret" (1978), alongside Terry Holiday and Francis . However, during rehearsals for a musical, she dared to tell actress Sasha Montenegro (star of the film) how to dance. Naturally, Montenegro ordered her out of the film, and her appearance was limited to a simple cameo from behind.
> 
> Another anecdote shared by Terry Holiday tells that when the film "Lipstick" premiered in Mexico in 1976, its star, actress and supermodel Margaux Hemigway, was invited to the premiere. Gina attended the event and her beauty baffled reporters, who photographed her believing that she was Hemigway herself.
> 
> According to the chronicles, she was a tremendous woman. She was a woman conscious of her beauty and sometimes abused it. There are not many details about her personal life, except for a relationship with a man called David D'Bico , who also appeared in the film "When the Spiders Weave" , and from whom she took her stage name.
> 
> In the early 1980s, Gina D'Bico decided to leave Mexico and went to the United States . According to the story, she fled from some problems she was facing with the law (causes unknown). She lived for some time in Hawaii and then settled in Los Angeles , California . In 1987, Gina D'Bico died tragically. According to the chronicles, she had saved money to buy a car. Some criminals learned of the existence of the money and decided to kill her to steal it. She died decapitated at the hands of her attackers. Another story says that her attacker was actually her partner, an African-American man with whom she lived.
> 
> As happens in thousands and thousands of these cases, her transfemicide did not transcend further. In Mexico, her death shocked all those who knew her, especially people from the LGBT+ community, for whom Gina was a myth and a reference. Mónica Alejandra "Naná" had already symbolically occupied her place as "Queen of the Zona Rosa" .
> 
> Gina D'Bico was not an activist or a militant fighter for LGBT+ causes, however, she is still a very important reference in the history of the collective in Mexico. She was a woman who did not need or seek to raise her voice to defend her guild. She simply decided to live her life with courage, facing a society that is much more rigid and cruel than today. This act of courage in life makes her a figure worth remembering and honoring as a tribute and seeking that, in this brief space, a record of her passage through this world and her splendor remains, as a reference for future generations.
