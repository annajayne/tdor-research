>
> She was tall, cheerful and did not mess around. Ana Paula Santos was 31 years old when she arrived in Palma in 1981 accompanied by José Manuel, her 25-year-old boyfriend. Both were Portuguese. The woman had previously undergone a sex change operation . On September 22 of that year, the landlord of her flat entered the house, alarmed because he had not heard from them for quite some time. Her body was found in an advanced state of decomposition and with three fatal stab wounds in the back. This is the story of a sordid crime that left many unknowns to be solved.
> 
> The couple had lived in Paris , where she was allegedly engaged in prostitution. There they had had problems with the authorities for a series of crimes, and decided to change their surroundings and travel to Mallorca in June 1981. They stayed in a miserable boarding house in Chinatown and later rented a second flat at number 5 on Vidrio Street, in the same neighborhood.
> 
> September was a hot year and the neighbors complained about the stench that reached the street from one of the flats in Chinatown. No one knew yet that it was the decomposing body of Ana, whom her roommates knew as 'the transsexual' . She herself had told them that she had had an operation in Morocco and that she had also undergone cosmetic surgery to modify her face .
> 
> "She was always on the same street with us, she never went far ," her companions said. However, between the end of August and the beginning of September, Ana disappeared . Everyone thought she had gone to Paris with her boyfriend, but the reality was different. On the 22nd of that month, the landlord broke into the flat, worried about the lack of news from the couple.
> 
> The smell was nauseating . So much so that when the police and judicial commission arrived they had to be equipped with oxygen masks . In a small bathroom, tilted on its right side, lay the lifeless body of Ana, the Portuguese woman. She was naked and there were three fatal stab wounds on her back. No trace of her boyfriend was found .
> 
> The crime scene was sealed off and near the decomposing body, which had been inert for nearly twenty days, were found the corpses of two Pekingese puppies that Ana had bought in Palma that summer. It was never clarified whether they had died of hunger or at the hands of the murderer.
> 
> From the very beginning, one detail caught the attention of the investigators: José Manuel DSG had mysteriously disappeared , as if by magic. And one detail increased the police's suspicions: shortly before Ana went up to her rented flat on Vidrio Street for the last time, she had had a huge fight with her boyfriend . Something relatively common and that is why it went unnoticed at first.
> 
> Then, with the appearance of the body, all suspicions focused on the young Portuguese man . His friends recalled that the last fight between them, when she went to the port of Palma to look for him, was loud and that the man returned to the flat with his shirt torn . The young man was wanted and Interpol followed his trail, in order to arrest him.
> 
> But he was not the only suspect . Days later, the National Police investigated a shady Swedish resident , who lived in the Cala Romántica area and was linked to the underworld. KHJ, those were his initials, had also been implicated in the death of a three-year-old child in the English city of Birmingham. The Nordic citizen had business in Portugal, where Ana and José Manuel came from, but resided in Mallorca.
> 
> There is evidence that she had contacts with José Manuel and the investigators came to the conclusion that the dark Swede, with a reputation for perverting , could have had some encounter with Ana. The case was finally closed with too many unknowns. The Portuguese woman's life in Palma was reconstructed: it was learned that she charged 1,000 pesetas (what would be six euros today) per service and that the fact that she had changed sex was an attraction for many clients.
