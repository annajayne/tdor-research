> Hello,
> 
> I do some research into historical unsolved cases in my country, and I stumbled upon one that I think may fit the site and I have the PDFs of the newspaper articles, but there's very little information.
> 
> Essentially the information is this:
> "Frederick Joseph Savoy" (only name listed, no chosen name or feminine name listed) is described as a "transvestite" who was stabbed to death on the 1200 block of Granville st in Vancouver, BC, Canada on April 25th, 1981. Savoy was also noted to be working as a sex worker. Savoy was included in articles around the time detailing the cases of 26 young women and girls who'd been murdered in the Vancouver to Alberta areas over the few years prior to the articles. Savoy was consistently listed as the "only outlier", but having seen how our local police and media have historically and currently treat trans women and sex workers, paired with the age of the article, I have a strong suspicion that Savoy may have been trans and it would be pertinent to add them to the list if you agree.

> If you need the articles you can email me and I can send them but I found Savoy's name mentioned in this way in the following papers (in my preliminary search, I intend to do a deeper dive):
> 
> The Windsor Star - November 19th 1981, page 57 The Vancouver Sun - September 16th, 1995, page A5 The Edmonton Journal - November 19th, 1981, page 50 The Red Deer Advocate - November 19th, 1981, Page 2A
