> I just want to explain why I'm going to do what I'm going to do. I've always wanted to be a boy. As a child, I needed a name, something that would say 'man' on my ID, and a piece of meat to be what I wanted to be and should be. However, since neither I nor those around me accepted that it was that strange, I always denied it and did everything possible not to notice it, although it was impossible to hide it, because it was what I really was inside. These were the last lines that Aimar 'Moio' Elosegi wrote on April 23, 2007 before committing suicide on the rocks of Santa Bárbara in Hernani, at just 21 years old.

> The need to review the collective (and personal) mourning that her death detailed in Euskadi has led to a reflective story about trans realities written by her close friend Kattalin Miner (Hernani, 1988). 'MOIO' (ed. Libros del KO, translation Irati Iturritza), recovers in Spanish her experiences seventeen years after her death.

> The almost 200 pages that Miner presents make up a fragmented essay armed with different voices. You hear that of Ander Elosegi Ansa, one of Aimar's brothers; that of a group of friends who silenced the pain for too long; that of Medeak, a transfeminist collective from Donostia; that of Maialen Lujanbio, the first woman to win the National Bertsolaris Championship and, later, save some verses for a trans person; that of the editor Iratxe Retolaza and that of Brayan Altimasberes, a trans boy from Hernani who today lives a completely different reality. All of them have, in some way – and even without knowing him – a relationship with Aimar-Aimaia (this is how 'Moio' asked that the names appear at the funeral in his memory "because they are both part of me").

> However, Miner warns: «It is not a biography. He was very shy and very in the background. At the end of the reading you end up getting to know him a little, but I save that for the people who knew him and loved him. "He did things the way he did them precisely so that he would not hide, so what I try to do is tell what his death meant and how he has changed the whole world." Furthermore, "if the situation began and ended with his suffering, he would take away a certain responsibility from those of us around him," he continues, after emphasizing that he sought to infuse the story with a "transformative force."

> Something that achieves. Because when we look back, the progress made since Aimar took his own life and his death was palpable in the Basque Country as one of the first cases of transphobia with a tragic ending. The evolution that has occurred from that moment to the present is due to the fact that Congress approved the 'Trans Law' a little over a year ago and the fact that "the trans issue is on TV and everywhere", as stated. write down in the book. However, all those interviewed agree that, in many aspects, "we still have to teach people." «I think that a large part of society, not having this reality close by, does not rethink many things. Sometimes we think that the problem lies with a trans person when they express their disagreement with the gender they have been given, but what this makes us see is that we have a very strict society with the man-woman binomial. You have to be very man or very woman when you walk and that in the end also falls into numerous stereotypes," says the author, who invites you to "change your perspective."
> 
> Call to institutions
> The case of Aimar, which made his name headline a street in Hernani in 2022, also reveals a reflection on the importance of narrating these cases "so that they do not happen again." It is already done through cultural products – as captured in the award-winning '20,000 species of bees' (2023, Estíbaliz Urresola) when inspired by Ekai Lersundi, the boy from Ondárroa who committed suicide in 2018 – but an urgent call is made to institutions to make this issue part of their priorities. "It is the environment that carries the memory and there is a danger that it will stay there," he writes to himself. "And it is no longer just an act of remembrance but of validating the lives that are being lived now as a way of repairing and giving us dignity and reason for being," concludes the author.
