> I just want to explain why I'm going to do what I'm going to do. I've always wanted to be a boy. As a child, I needed a name, something that would say 'man' on my ID, and a piece of meat to be what I wanted to be and should be. However, since neither I nor those around me accepted that it was that strange, I always denied it and did everything possible not to notice it, although it was impossible to hide it, because it was what I really was inside. These were the last lines that Aimar 'Moio' Elosegi wrote on April 23, 2007 before committing suicide on the rocks of Santa Bárbara in Hernani, at just 21 years old.

> The almost 200 pages that Miner presents make up a fragmented essay armed with different voices. You hear that of Ander Elosegi Ansa, one of Aimar's brothers; that of a group of friends who silenced the pain for too long; that of Medeak, a transfeminist collective from Donostia; that of Maialen Lujanbio, the first woman to win the National Bertsolaris Championship and, later, save some verses for a trans person; that of the editor Iratxe Retolaza and that of Brayan Altimasberes, a trans boy from Hernani who today lives a completely different reality. All of them have, in some way – and even without knowing him – a relationship with Aimar-Aimaia (this is how 'Moio' asked that the names appear at the funeral in his memory "because they are both part of me").

> However, Miner warns: «It is not a biography. He was very shy and very in the background. At the end of the reading you end up getting to know him a little, but I save that for the people who knew him and loved him. "He did things the way he did them precisely so that he would not hide, so what I try to do is tell what his death meant and how he has changed the whole world." Furthermore, "if the situation began and ended with his suffering, he would take away a certain responsibility from those of us around him," he continues, after emphasizing that he sought to infuse the story with a "transformative force."
> 
> Something that achieves. Because when we look back, the progress made since Aimar took his own life and his death was palpable in the Basque Country as one of the first cases of transphobia with a tragic ending. The evolution that has occurred from that moment to the present is due to the fact that Congress approved the 'Trans Law' a little over a year ago and the fact that "the trans issue is on TV and everywhere", as stated. write down in the book. However, all those interviewed agree that, in many aspects, "we still have to teach people." «I think that a large part of society, not having this reality close by, does not rethink many things. Sometimes we think that the problem lies with a trans person when they express their disagreement with the gender they have been given, but what this makes us see is that we have a very strict society with the man-woman binomial. You have to be very man or very woman when you walk and that in the end also falls into numerous stereotypes," says the author, who invites you to "change your perspective."
> 
> Call to institutions
> The case of Aimar, which made his name headline a street in Hernani in 2022, also reveals a reflection on the importance of narrating these cases "so that they do not happen again." It is already done through cultural products – as captured in the award-winning '20,000 species of bees' (2023, Estíbaliz Urresola) when inspired by Ekai Lersundi, the boy from Ondárroa who committed suicide in 2018 – but an urgent call is made to institutions to make this issue part of their priorities. "It is the environment that carries the memory and there is a danger that it will stay there," he writes to himself. "And it is no longer just an act of remembrance but of validating the lives that are being lived now as a way of repairing and giving us dignity and reason for being," concludes the author.




> Kattalin Miner and the story of Moio, her trans friend who committed suicide: "I went from guilt to responsibility. We must remember before we lose it"

> In 2007, Aimar Elosegi, a trans boy from Hernani, in Gipuzkoa, who was known to his friends as Moio, committed suicide. It was a blow not only for his family and friends, but for the entire town, which devoted itself to Aimar's memory of him, trying to turn that duel into a process that would serve to understand and learn. The journalist Kattalin Miner, a close friend of Moio, has written a book that serves to recover his story of him, do justice to his memory of him and analyze the personal and collective feelings that were triggered as a result of that death. That book is titled 'MOIO' (Books of the KO) and Kattalin Miner has passed through the SER microphones, in 'Hora 25' with Aimar Bretos.

> "More than time, we have to start remembering when we see that we are going to lose it. I saw that this story was being silenced. After 10 years it was no longer being talked about," says Miner. The journalist says that she was called Moio for an intuitive reason. "He liked it a lot, he always felt very comfortable. He signed his name like that and it seemed like an affectionate way to call him that. It is a more intuitive and primal name for his transition," says the writer.
> 
> Aimar's transition began two years before his death. He first started leaving clues, which later became "evidence." Afterwards she began to talk one by one with her friends. "At that time we had no references. He explained to us that he was not a girl, that he had always felt that he was a boy. Pronouns were not a big problem because we spoke in Basque. It seemed strange to me, but only for a while. It was little by little. and then very intuitive," says Miner.
> 
> Kattalin relates that a teacher took roll in class with her girl's name, Amaia, even though he had already told her that he did not want to be named as such. "It screwed up his life. When the transition began, he decided to go to Bilbao and start from scratch, start like Aimar. Then there was no trans law or anything. He took the time to explain it one by one to the teachers. It was a very big downfall." , says Miner. "He was a very lucid person and he saw that, given what he had seen, he could never become what he was. He saw a lifetime of fighting, of explaining who he is. He left it written very clearly," he says.

> "The letter is very shocking, but when you get to that point in the book you don't think about the morbidity. I think the reader appreciates the realism," explains the writer. What is grief derived from suicide like? What specificities does it have? "The feeling that goes through you the most is guilt. You always have the feeling of not having done everything possible or not having been right. I went from guilt to responsibility. It is not a duty, but rather a desire to remember. Grief is different because you can go through anger. I got angry about two years old, but it didn't last long. I understood that his suicide was derived from a social situation," says the journalist.
> 
> "His death is the event that has changed my life the most. It has been very shocking for me and for who I am now," says Miner. "My biggest fear was associating transness with tragedy, with suffering. It was an exercise in memory, but I didn't want you to end up in ruins. That's why the last interview I do is with Brian, whose story is lighter. He appeared and in That point is where the person ends up healed. There is that tolerant progressive idea of ??"it seems good to me, but it doesn't touch me" and I think we have to change that idea in both children and adults. "to children and adults that being trans is the most wonderful thing in the world? Why aren't there positive messages in the process of transition?" he says. "What makes trans people and their decisions problematic and violent is their environment. Can you be happy by breaking one of the biggest established social rules? I think so, but you are going to have to fight for many things. There is going to be violence, but also wonderful things and can be extrapolated to other parts of life," he says.
> 
> Regarding the debate within feminism about the trans and feminist struggle, about whether they should be struggles at the same time or if one eclipses the other, the author reflects: "These are new debates. Imported many times. What I did not expect "It was violence and virulence. There is a very great and excessive hatred against trans people, but I am quite optimistic and realistic. The debates have been used, but I believe that most of the feminist movement is transinclusive."
