> Mexico's most famous transvestite broke new ground in nightlife.
> June 28, 2025 • Mr. Pepe Rivero
> 
> Francis, whose real name was Francisco del Carmen García Escalante, died on October 10, 2007, at the age of 49, in Mexico City.
> Days before her death, Francis began experiencing severe back pain while performing a show in Puebla. Her discomfort quickly worsened, causing difficulty breathing, and she was transferred to a hospital in Mexico City. There, she fell into a coma and died shortly after.
> 
> The cause of death was pulmonary thromboembolism, a serious condition that occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery in the lungs.
> 
> Francis was a beloved figure in Mexican entertainment, recognized for her impersonations, her Broadway-style show, and her pioneering role in the representation of sexual and gender diversity in mass media, at a time when such behavior was justifiable as discrimination.
> 
> Why is it important to remember Francis?
> Francis was not only a star of the show, but a pioneer who challenged gender norms and created spaces for diversity in a time of severe discrimination.
> 
> Francis left a deeply significant artistic and social legacy in Mexico, especially for the LGBT+ community, by being a pioneer in successfully presenting a show of the level and quality she achieved.
> 
> Francis was one of the first artists to bring drag to the country's major stages. Her show, "El Show de Francis," ran for more than 15 years, filling venues like the Blanquita Theater and touring throughout Mexico and the United States.
> 
> She impersonated figures such as Lupita D'Alessio and Liza Minnelli, and designed all the costumes for her show. She was also a pioneer of stand-up comedy, making her audiences laugh with her antics.
> 
> She participated in films such as Bellas de noche (1975), De super macho a super hembra (1989) and television programs such as Mujer, casos de la vida real, La fea más bella and Desde Gayola, something that gave visibility to transvestism on television, something that did not happen at the time.
