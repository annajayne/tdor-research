> 
> Roberto González Onrubia, a 26-year-old transgender man, was killed by two formerly homeless cisgender women who had found refuge in his apartment, in Madrid, Spain. The women took over his house and held him prisoner for a year before he died. They had been subjecting him to transphobic sexual threats, humiliation, torture, and violence. Roberto was beaten to death on 29 August 2007. Both women were condemned to 19 years in prison and fined â‚¬90 000. Quotes (with sources): "On more than one occasion Reyes Navarro and BergantiÃ±os forced Onrubia to wear womenâ€™s clothing and threatened to prostitute him for additional cash. They did it both to humiliate him as a trans man and to intimidate him sexually, relying on both transphobia and sexism in the sex industry to menace Onrubia as much as their own behavior. They also forced him to give up much of the outward markers that allowed him to live in his chosen gender while again filming the abuse." "Onrubiaâ€™s was found, disfigured by physical abuse, dead in his own excrement and urine. It was clear he had been forced to spend an unknown amount of months living and sleeping on the same mattress where he was forced to go to the bathroom rather than be allowed to use the facilities in the home. He was also extremely malnurished at the time of his death; Reyes Navarro and BergantiÃ±os took pleasure in denying him food and may have even linked the starvation to their transphobic torture by telling him his dwindling body helped him look â€œmore like a man.â€ (https://likeawhisper.wordpress.com/2010/04/11/a-testament-to-evil/) "[â€¦] once they stripped him naked and forced him to shave his entire body, while they were recording. It was a way to steal one of his male secondary sex characteristics (body hair) [â€¦] They also dressed him up as a girl with high heels and a miniskirt, something they knew he rejected, and threatened to pimp him out as a prostitute." 



 
> A verdict has come in, in the August murder of Roberto González Onrubia in Spain. In 2006 Onrubia reached out to two homeless cis women, Dolores de los Reyes Navarro and Ainhoa Nogales Bergantiños, in the hopes of providing them an opportunity to get back on their feet. While the potential “guilty liberal” politics of such a decision are questionable, they did not justify the violence and humiliation Reyes Navarro and Bergantiños heaped upon him for the misguided attempt to help them out. Within a few months of moving in, they took over his home and kept him prisoner in his bedroom while they sold his mother’s jewelry and his inherited stamp collection. His attempts to free himself where met with both physical violence and transphobic and cissupremacist sexual threats. On more than one occasion Reyes Navarro and Bergantiños forced Onrubia to wear women’s clothing and threatened to prostitute him for additional cash. They did it both to humiliate him as a trans man and to intimidate him sexually, relying on both transphobia and sexism in the sex industry to menace Onrubia as much as their own behavior. They also forced him to give up much of the outward markers that allowed him to live in his chosen gender while again filming the abuse.

> When the two women had sold all of the furniture and possessions in Onrubia’s home, they beat him to death.

> Onrubia’s was found, disfigured by physical abuse, dead in his own excrement and urine. It was clear he had been forced to spend an unknown amount of months living and sleeping on the same mattress where he was forced to go to the bathroom rather than be allowed to use the facilities in the home. He was also extremely malnurished at the time of his death; Reyes Navarro and Bergantiños took pleasure in denying him food and may have even linked the starvation to their transphobic torture by telling him his dwindling body helped him look “more like a man.”

> While the abuse in this story is horrifying, one has to ask why none of his neighbors, co-workers, or friends asked what happened to him. Though he did receive calls during this time, Reyes Navarro and Bergantiños took his cellphone and screened his calls. No one seems to have done more than a preliminary inquiry about where Onrubia was and why he had allowed these two women to sell everything he owned. Was he ignored because he was trans  or did he lack an extensive support network because he had transitioned and was rebuilding his life? Either way, his vulnerability seemed to be clearly linked to cissupremacy that often requires people to start completely over when they transition.
> 
> For their crimes, Dolores de los Reyes Navarro and Ainhoa Nogales Bergantiños were fined US$180,000 and sentenced to 18 years each in prison. While it is an impressive conviction given the slap on the wrist most murderers of transgender people receive, can we really put a price on the life of any person, especially one who tried to help others survive?



> Via El Pais (translation by the OII’s founder, Curtis Hinkle), this report is a rare example of the abuses that can be inflicted on trans men by cis women; in this case two cis women who imprisoned a trans man in his own home and, over a nine month period, tortured and eventually murdered him.
> 
> In 2006 the man, Roberto González Onrubia, had invited two cis women, Dolores de los Reyes Navarro and Ainhoa Nogales Bergantiños, to stay at his house. Prior to that, the cis women had “lived in a shack” in poverty. The cis women proceeded to take advantage of Mr Onrubia’s kindness, taking money without repaying it, and the arrangement quickly became abusive towards Mr Onrubia. By the following year, 2007, the situation had become untenable for Mr Onrubia and he asked the cis women to leave. They refused and began a campaign of abuse against him with the aim of making it impossible for Mr Onrubia to evict them.
> 
> In March the imprisonment began. “They changed the lock of the apartment without giving him a copy.” “They also seized his mobile phone and started answering all the calls received,” and “kept the blinds closed in the room where he was sleeping, so he could not ask for help from neighbors.”
> 
> In May, “they began to sell all property that was in his home, such as jewelry and his mother’s coats, watches and a stamp collection he had from his father.” Also by that time “they began to hit Roberto often”. The next step in the looting came later, when they put the victims apartment on sale, and kept the deposit. At the same time, the abuse and malnourishment continued. At that time, Roberto lost 40 kilos.
> 
> In that same month, the cis women forced him to sign, in a school notebook owned by Ainhoa Nogales Bergantiños, a statement that he willingly authorised both of them to remain at his home until they could get their own house. The abuses continued, including attacks on Mr Onrubia’s gender identity:
> 
> […] once they stripped him naked and forced him to shave his entire body, while they were recording. It was a way to steal one of his male secondary sex characteristics (body hair) […] They also dressed him up as a girl with high heels and a miniskirt, something they knew he rejected, and threatened to pimp him out as a prostitute.
> 
> Finally, on the night of August 29, the cis women beat him to death.
> 
> “Roberto was found murdered on September 1, 2007 at his home, naked, on a mattress on the floor without sheets, without a pillow, filled with urine and feces; his body, which showed clear signs of malnutrition, was full of bruises of varying degrees, and his face with open, unhealed wounds was disfigured by apparent blows with one of them ending his life” and is described on the website Diario Digital Transexual.
> 
> Each of the cis women was sentenced to 18 years in prison and ordered to pay costs and a fine of €90 000 to be paid to the estate of Mr Onrubia.
> 
> There’s little I can add to this horrific account except to say: RIP Roberto González Onrubia, mi hermano.
