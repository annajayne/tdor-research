> Brazil's most feared transvestite ruled downtown São Paulo and had 7 lives.
> They said she could only be killed if she was hit in the face, as more than 50 stabs from the neck down were not enough.

> Cris Negão was in front of the Elenice bar in downtown São Paulo when she was shot three times in the face by a man less than half a meter tall and wearing shorts and flip-flops. The legend was true that she could only be killed if hit in the face, as her body was sealed from the neck down and had seven lives.
> 
> Cristiane Jordan, known as the troublemaker Cris Negão , passed away on the night of September 6, 2007, to the relief of many and the sadness of her few friends. Difficult in temperament, violent, and addicted to alcohol, she ruled downtown São Paulo for many years and was even feared by the authorities.
> 
> Cris Negão ruled Rua Amaral Gurgel and the surrounding area. She owned all the prostitution spots for travestis, who paid fees to stay there and had to rely on luck to find her in a good mood, as new fees were imposed simply if Cris didn't like something about them. Even their way of speaking.
> 
> Hustlers, drug dealers, pickpockets, thieves, and travestis roamed the area under Cris's intense supervision and control. If there was a disagreement, she was there, ready to settle it with her own hands, since she wasn't armed. She liked to settle things with a good old-fashioned punch, and she beat up many people. Cris was truly feared by everyone.
> 
> Now it's mine
> Cris also had a habit of literally taking from travestis anything she saw and liked about their clothing. If one of them came in with a wig that Cris liked, she would say, "My wig looks really pretty on your head." The person would get the message and hand over the accessory. If they didn't understand, she would settle the matter with a fight. It was that simple.

> But not everyone wanted Cris to disappear like a summer shower. Many transvestites who worked with her said they didn't suffer assaults, insults, or beatings from clients or other men passing through downtown, because Cris, upon learning of the crimes, would seek satisfaction and... guess what: with punches, kicks, and kicks, she would drive the troublemakers far away.
> 
> Cris had more than 50 bruises and/or marks and scars from her neck down, resulting from the dozens of attempted murders she had suffered. On one occasion, according to a close friend who told UOL, she was stabbed more than 20 times and wasn't even hospitalized.
> 
> Based on this, a myth was created that her body was sealed shut, and could only be killed if she was hit in the face. Which is what happened, as we previously reported.
> 
> Since Cris's death, the cycle of the great transvestites who were pimps in downtown São Paulo has closed, and the abuses and crimes against these professionals have increased significantly, since she managed to command respect from miles away.
> 
> When she was killed, in front of the bar, screams resembling a Brazilian goal in a World Cup final were heard for long minutes. It was a celebration of the death of this mythological guardian who made history in the central region of one of Brazil's largest cities.
