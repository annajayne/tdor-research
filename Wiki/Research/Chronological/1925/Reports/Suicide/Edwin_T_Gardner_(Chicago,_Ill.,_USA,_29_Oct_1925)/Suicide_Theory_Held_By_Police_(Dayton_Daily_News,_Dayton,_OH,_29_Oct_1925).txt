===== SUICIDE THEORY HELD BY POLICE =====

==== Parents of Chicago Student Agree With Officers In Probe of Hanging. ====

CHICAGO. Oct 29.—(AP)—Suicide, the police agreed, caused the death of Edwin T. Gardner, 28-ycar-old student, found last night by his father hanging from a rafter in the attic of his home, attired in feminine garb and wearing a wig. Although his wrists and ankles were tied with twine, the father, Robert S. Gardner, and investigators, theorized that the youth, who was said to be an ambitious worker in the chemical department of a packing plant, had constructed the setting to give the death the appearance of murder.
