===== Man Found Hanged Attired As Woman =====
Chicago, Ill., Oct. 29 (AP).—Attired in feminine clothing, with a woman’s wig on his head, the body of Edwin T. Gardner, 28, was found hanging in the attic of the family home.

Robert S. Gardner, his father, discovered the body suspended from a rafter, several inches above the floor. The man’s wrists were bound behind him in such a way, police said, as to preclude suicide.

Gardner and his mother were alone in the house during the afternoon. She was incoherent when police arrived.

The father could give no information as to a motive either for suicide or murder.
