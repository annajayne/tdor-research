> 
> Alícia disappeared on February 12, in Jardim Helvécia, in Aparecida de Goiânia. Initially, the case was investigated by delegate Luiza Veneranda, from the 1st Police District (DP). Delegate Jonatas Barbosa, from the 4th DP, took over the case and requested it be archived in January of this year. Afterwards, the investigation was summarized and concluded by delegate Fabrício Flávio, from the State Criminal Investigations Office (Deic).
> 
> "The crime was premeditated and orchestrated by the perpetrators. Today we seek to give some relief to this family, the mother waited for her daughter for 1 year and 7 months", said the police chief.
>
> When she disappeared, Alicia was wearing light blue jeans, black heeled boots, an orange collared blouse and had red hair. Her mother says that Alicia did not say anything where she was going, but that she always came home the next day after leaving and never did like that. Fabricia says that her daughter has no enemies and she fears that someone has harmed her because she is transsexual.
> 
> “Sunday morning I didn't see her in the room and I called. The cell phone was turned off and the messages were not delivered. We tracked the device and it was in Jardim Dom Bosco, we walked all over the region and it didn't work”, says Fabricia da Silva, Alicia's mother.
>
> According to the police, the DNA confirmation was carried out in the last 40 days, when the case came under the care of the State Criminal Investigations Office (DEIC). The police chief explained that the crime occurred on the same day as the disappearance. The Civil Police reported that the report on the cause of death should be released next week.
> 
> The Public Ministry (MP) reported that prosecutor Simone Disconsi de Sá Campos would request additional measures, as well as the involvement of other investigative units. "She had prior access to the investigation and says that she does not agree with the request for archiving", states the agency (see full note at the end of the report).
> 
> According to the investigator, the police tried every alternative to try to locate the young woman. “All measures and all paths have been taken. Everything you do in life reaches a point where there is nothing left to do. We asked for breaches of telephone confidentiality and spoke to people who knew the young woman, but no one has any information about her,” she said.
> 
> Delegate Jonatas Barbosa detailed that searches were carried out at the Legal Medical Institute (IML), in hospitals, airports and bus stations. “We tried everything that could have been done and there is nothing left to do, until something new emerges: a witness who reports her possible whereabouts. Unfortunately, it has reached a place where we no longer have anywhere to try, so we have requested it be archived,” he explains.
> 
> Family
> The police chief states that he did not speak to the young woman's family about the closure of the investigation. Despite this, Alícia's mother, day laborer Fabricia da Silva Pereira, 41 years old, says that she went to the police station and was unable to speak to the police chief, but was informed by reception about the request. She claims that the investigator did not follow her and that she is angry.
> 
> “My life stopped on February 12th, because I can't move my life forward, I can't live anything else and my thoughts every day are just this. It is distressing to imagine that she is dead or trapped somewhere. With this request from the police chief, I feel very angry, hurt and angry because he said he did everything and didn't do it”, she emphasizes.
> 
> The diarist states that, after taking over the case, the delegate did not try again to address the points left by the first delegate in the case. “He didn’t insist on looking for images and trying to locate my daughter, that’s the truth. He simply wants to hand over the case,” she says. g1 tried to speak to the investigator about Fabrícia's accusations, but was unsuccessful.
> 
> Full text of the MP-GO note:
>
> "The Public Ministry of Goiás (MPGO) clarifies that the police investigation was sent this afternoon to the 7th Public Prosecutor's Office of Aparecida de Goiânia, which has responsibility in the court responsible for the case. However, prosecutor Simone Disconsi de Sá Campos (currently responsible for the 7th PJ of Aparecida de Goiânia) clarifies that she had prior access to the investigation and adds that she does not agree with the request for archiving. She adds that she will request additional steps, as well as the involvement of other investigative units.'

> 
> Deputy Jonatas Barbosa asked for the investigation to be closed on January 26 of this year, shortly before the disappearance completed one year. He argued that the investigation had reached an "impasse" and that the case should be archived "until new information emerges".
> 
> It turns out, however, that the investigator ignored reports from the delegate who had begun to investigate the case, Luiza Veneranda.
> 
> The inquiry was sent to the Goiás Public Prosecutor's Office ( MPGO ), which will still give an opinion on whether or not it agrees with the archiving.
