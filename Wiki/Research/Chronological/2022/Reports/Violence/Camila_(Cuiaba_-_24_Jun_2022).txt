> In addition, Ivaldo Leite de Araújo will be tried in December [2024]. He committed a series of crimes in a nightclub in June 2022, resulting in the murder of trans woman Camila, who was killed by blows from a piece of wood. He initially broke into one of the rooms in the establishment and struck Fernando Silva do Amaral, an employee who was sleeping after work, with several blows. The attacks resulted in serious injuries to his right arm, causing permanent weakness. Ivaldo then broke into another room, where he found Camila, who was also sleeping.
