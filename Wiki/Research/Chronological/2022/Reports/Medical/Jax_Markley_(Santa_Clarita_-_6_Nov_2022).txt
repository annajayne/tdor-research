> Hi, my name is Matt Markley and I am fundraising seed money to pay a portion of the initial setup costs for two projects honoring the memory of our beloved 18-year-old, Jax Markley, who we lost to fentanyl poisoning on 11/6/22.
> 
> The first project is called "Justice for Jax" and will be devoted to the effort of demanding justice for Jax and other victims of the confluence of bad actors responsible for Jax's loss -- the dealers, distributors, drug companies, social media companies and others who profit from our suffering. We will build an online presence around this project, where organizational, volunteer and financial support will be made available for thoughtfully vetted organizations in service of issues that were either near and dear to Jax or bring honor to their memory. Issues like trans/LGBTQ+ rights, neurodiversity, mental health awareness, social media harms, and of course the prevention and enforcement of illicit fentanyl and synthetic opioids. We aim to strategically put the resources where and when they're most needed.
> 
> The second project is a new organization called "Not Just a Statistic" which will be strictly devoted to the reliable, politically agnostic collection and statistical reporting of fentanyl-related deaths in LA County, to be eventually scaled to state and national levels with continued support. The data we compile and model will be an invaluable resource for the countless organizations already at the forefront of the war against illicit synthetic opioids. "NJAS" will not be flashy, politically active, or opinionated -- its sole objective is to do the statistical grunt work that is so sorely needed in this space -- so that others can make use of it. Nothing more, nothing less.
> 
> We are filing proper EINs, but those take time to process, and the costs of simply setting up domains, web hosting and design, registering agents and filing paperwork with the state all add up. We could use a jump start.
> 
> Trust is paramount for us. Full, transparent reporting will be made available to all donors so you can rest assured in the knowledge that all contributions will be spent thoughtfully and 100% in keeping with our mission.
> 
> Thank you in advance for your support!




> Remembering Jax Markley, 18
> Jax Markley was too good for this world, his father Matt Markley says.
> 
> The Santa Clarita teen was always opening their heart and home to those in need – from the gay kid at school whose parents didn’t accept him to the sickly goose they insisted on rescuing at the local pond.

> But, on Nov. 6, 2022, Jax’s heart stopped. The cause of death: a fentanyl-laced pill.
> 
> “I touched Jax and they were cold,” Daisy Markley says recalling the morning she found Jax, who used the pronoun “they”, dead in bed. “They fell over and there was black bruising on their face. I started screaming for Matt.”
> 
> “I’ll never forget that sound,” Matt Markley adds.
> 
> The following months were a tornado of grief, guilt and anguish as the couple tried to figure out where they went wrong as parents.
> 
> Jax was a happy, smiley baby, the kind that strangers couldn’t help but dote upon. Growing up, Jax loved Disneyland trips with mom and listening to classic rock with dad.
> 
> At about 13, Jax, who was named Genevieve at birth, told their parents that they were transgender.
> 
> “I helped Jax pick out their name and we fully supported it,” says Matt Markley. “We were like, ‘Let me know what you want and we will get you the help that you need.’”
> 
> But acceptance at home didn’t mean acceptance everywhere. In middle school, the outgoing, theatrical kid became anxious and withdrawn.
> 
> Then COVID-19 came along and the bad became worse. Therapy moved online, friends were confined to a screen, and Jax retreated further into themselves. A boyfriend brought high-highs, low-lows and, Daisy and Matt Markley say, probable connections to drug sellers.
> 
> The Markleys knew their teen had experimented with alcohol and marijuana. They both tried to educate Jax about the dangers without being judgmental and established home as a safe place for discussing any issues.
> 
> But fentanyl-laced pills were a devil the Markleys didn’t see coming. And the stigma surrounding drugs was strong enough, Matt Markley said, that Jax never felt comfortable sharing their illicit substance use.
> 
> Since Jax’s death, the Markleys have become involved in spreading awareness about the dangers of fentanyl and calling on policymakers to invest in solutions.
> 
> Through this advocacy work, they met several other parents who also lost kids to fentanyl and began noticing troubling patterns: COVID-19 and depression. Social media and bullying. Sexual identity and isolation. Factor in the rising cost of living, spiraling student debt, and threat of climate change — today’s world can feel like a scary place.
> 
> “These are all pressures that factor into why fentanyl is killing so many of our kids,” Jax’s father says, adding that it’s important for older generations to understand the challenges today’s youth faces.
> 
> Now, more than a year later, the couple is finally reaching an answer to the question of what they could have done better:
> 
> “We did everything we could,” says Matt Markley. “We’re finally getting to a place where our sense of reason is catching up with our overwhelming guilt for having failed to do something to make things different. There’s so much out of our control, and this tragedy is not unique to us.”
