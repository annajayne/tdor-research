Penal Unit 32, Florencio Varela
Argentina
died in custody


> Mónica Mego was a 36-year-old trans woman who died at home, after having been detained in Penal Unit 32 of Florencio Varela, with serious health problems and without receiving medical assistance. The Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM) presented itself as an individual institutional victim in the case. In recent weeks, a prison chief and seven prison doctors were prosecuted.
> 
> The CPM made various judicial presentations and requested a precautionary measure before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) “denouncing the denial of the health system suffered by the entire trans community in prisons dependent on the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service (SPB) .” In this sense, it is worth highlighting that all reports prepared on confinement institutions indicate that the first cause of death is because access to health is sporadic; practically zero.
> 
> Prosecution order for the death of the trans woman
> The head of the Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Occurring in Prison Units of the Judicial Department of La Plata, Gonzalo Petit Bosnic, in recent weeks decided to prosecute the eight defendants. These are the head of care and treatment Juan Manuel González and his agents Walter Raúl Piñón, Matías Pérez Núñez, Francisco Artola, Claudio Piccin, Elvira Tucto and María Guzmán.
> 
> All of them must appear before the magistrate between May 27 and June 4 to be investigated for the terrible events that occurred. The Preparatory Criminal Investigation (IPP) “pursues the crimes of aggravated abandonment of a person, humiliation, severity and negligent injuries,” Sandra Raggio, general director of the CPM, explained to Tiempo .
> 
> So far, investigators have collected sufficient evidence to prove a situation of abandonment of the person. In the current stage of the process, they were able to prove that between February 16 and March 21, 2019 in UP 32, “one of the heads of the prison's assistance and treatment area, surnamed González, abandoned the victim while "She was housed in diversity pavilion 11 of module C, suffering from lack of access to health," denounced the general director.
> 
> Institutional apathy
> He also pointed out that Mónica's story in punitive confinement "is one of institutional apathy, violence and discrimination exercised by a prison system that violates the rights of trans people," Raggio described. For six months, the victim “requested medical assistance, warning that she felt severe pain in her back, she did not receive help, her condition worsened to the point of not being able to walk alone, she contracted paralysis,” she reconstructed.
> 
> First he was in the Pettinato Alcaidía and then in the Florencio Varela Penal Unit 32, “where he only received paracetamol and ibuprofen,” said the general director. She continued to relate, “when she was referred to the San Martín Hospital it was already too late, her illness had advanced a lot.”
> 
> Cause of paralysis
> Raggio explained that when she arrived at the hospital in terrible condition, “she was operated on for an 'epidural abscess in the spinal cord due to tuberculosis', which was what caused the permanent paralysis of her lower limbs and the need to use a urinary catheter, among other serious problems that he suffered.”
> 
> For all this, the head of the assistance and treatment area, “has just been prosecuted for abandonment of a qualified person and injuries,” he noted. He is also accused of having committed “severities and humiliations to which he subjected the victim when she was re-admitted to the prison after the surgical intervention,” denounced the general director.
> 
> During the investigation, it was discovered that the González penitentiary "treated her very badly, despite her serious health situation, he locked her in a punishment box, there the victim received humiliating and degrading treatment due to her condition as a trans woman," Raggio stressed. .  
> 
> They were also able to prove that the other seven agents prosecuted are part of the health personnel of prisons 32 and 23 of the Florencio Varela Prison Complex and that they acted as accomplices and aggravated this terrible situation. These are the penitentiaries Walter Raúl Piñón, Matías Pérez Núñez, Francisco Artola, Claudio Piccin, Elvira Tucto and María Guzmán.
> 
> Transfer to the extramural hospital
> The investigation of the case also reveals that none of the accused agents requested his transfer to the local hospital; “Nurse Vanesa Ramírez did it, after the victim's constant complaints,” Raggio said.
> 
> He continued by recalling that “we interviewed the victim in 2019, when she was admitted to the San Martín de La Plata Hospital, from that moment on, we carried out joint actions with her defense and made presentations before the courts and other State agencies.”
> 
> At the end of 2021, “the detainee was dismissed, the doctrine and jurisprudence of natural punishment was applied to her, understanding that the health conditions that the woman had suffered made it possible to avoid the prison sentence that could be imposed,” he argued.
> 
> However, shortly after, on March 10, 2022, the trans woman died and we accompanied her family - who is from Peru - and presented ourselves as a private institutional victim to ensure that those responsible for such an aberrant act are tried and convicted. , for the cruel and inhuman treatment they carried out,” concluded the general director.



> Mónica Mego, victim of the penal system, died
>
> The trans woman had been detained and became paraplegic because she was denied medical care during the first six months of her confinement . Due to the serious deterioration of her health and the irreversible consequences that this left her, the case had been acquitted at the end of last year. Her condition never completely improved and, despite her efforts to ensure that she receives comprehensive treatment, Mónica Mego died yesterday at the age of 36.
> 
> WALK in La Plata
> 
> ( Andar Agency ) Mónica Mego was arrested four years ago. She was in wardens and penal units in the province of Buenos Aires where she was denied medical assistance during the first six months of confinement. When she was arrested, she already presented a complex clinical condition that worsened both due to the neglect of her condition and the poor or late care that followed . The consequences were very serious: she lost sphincter control, the mobility of her lower limbs and suffered other bodily injuries.
> 
> In state custody, Mónica suffered irreversible damage . From the Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM), presentations were made regarding her situation before the courts , other state agencies and even before the IACHR and it was articulated with her defense and other organizations. Her goal was to achieve her release and guarantee comprehensive treatment for her health.
> 
> In December of last year, almost a year and a half after her defenders requested it, Mónica was acquitted . The doctrine and jurisprudence of “natural punishment” were applied, understanding that the sufferings suffered by the woman allowed the punishment that could be imposed on her to be dispensed with.
> 
> However, like many other trans people, Mónica died before her 40th birthday. This is the average life expectancy of a trans person in Latin America and the Caribbean, unlike the general life expectancy of the region, which is 75 years.
