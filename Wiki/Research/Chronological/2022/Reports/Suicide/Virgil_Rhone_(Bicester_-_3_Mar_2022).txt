suicide



> Virgil Rhone. 15. March 3, 2022. Narrative verdict. "Intent was uncertain"
>  
> Virgil was "relentlessly bullied" at school & had dropped out of education to be homeschooled. They had recently started college where they had 'found their tribe'. Virgil's death was unexpected.
> 
> Coroner criticised CAMHS failings: lack of information sharing between services & lack of continuity of care. CAMHS counselling "ended after six sessions". Virgil should have seen a clinical psychologist a "year earlier". At death they were on a waiting list for more support.
> 
> "Virgil was such a supportive person & helped people feel really comfortable with who they were..I think often the people who need help do it for other people". Virgil Died Waiting For Care #DWFC.
