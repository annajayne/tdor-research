> La lucha por la memoria de Daniela, la joven trans que quisieron “curar” en un convento
> Daniela died every morning when she woke up. Her parents told her she had "a demon inside her ," called her Juan, forced her to dress like a boy, and allegedly took her to a convent to medicate her. To "cure" her.
> 
> Daniela (Kendall to her friends) was a trans woman who ended up broken in a convent where sexual conversion therapies were allegedly applied . At 14, she came out of the closet, and from that "sin" her hell began . At 15, she entered that monastery, and at 17, she ended up in a juvenile detention center, banished by her family. On April 17, 2022, at 22, she took her own life in Santander. Her parents, who neither understood nor accepted her, had kicked her out of the house for years and didn't speak to her.
> 
> Her remains lie in Aspe (Alicante) on a tombstone with a photo from before her transition that reads "Juan," a name she always rejected and which she changed at the Madrid civil registry. Her friends, along with the Euforia Familias Trans Aliadas association, have initiated a lawsuit against the authorities for her dignity and memory . "It's abhorrent. It's a monument to her suffering ," laments her friend Alana. The goal is for Daniela's tombstone to read "Daniela." 
> 
> "The photo of the tombstone is abhorrent. It's a monument to her suffering," says her friend Alana Pantaleón.
> This newspaper has contacted friends and several victims of sexual conversion therapy who met Daniela at the convent to share her story. It has also contacted her family, but has not received a response.
> 
> The mother house
> Pedro met Daniela at the Ruiloba convent (Cantabria). It was 2015, and she was 15 years old. The building was allegedly used as the "mother house" for a network of sexual conversion therapies to "cure" gay, lesbian, and trans youth, according to several victims who have told this newspaper, and is listed in a complaint filed against the organization called "Hope Is Possible."
> 
> There, Daniela wasn't Daniela. She was Juan. She dressed like a boy, was forced to do physical labor and pray several times a day, and had a soccer game on Saturdays as part of this supposed "therapy." Despite being a minor, she was constantly medicated with antidepressants or libido suppressants , according to Pedro, Xavi, and Mario, three of the victims who shared that ordeal with her.
> 
> "They medicated her heavily, along with other people. There were days when she couldn't get out of bed until 11 a.m. because of all the work she was carrying," Xavi says. He claims that Daniela self-harmed and attempted suicide several times in the convent , without receiving specialized medical assistance after each one. "She kept telling us, 'I want to be a woman,' and they won't let me," Xavi recalls.
> 
> Attacks on LGBTI people have doubled in one year, according to the state federation.
> She was eventually placed in a juvenile facility, where the administration removed her custody from her family and was able to provide her with the help she needed. Her family banished her and stopped calling her.
> 
> The difficult path
> Daniela lived in several sheltered apartments for minors and ended up on the streets on several occasions . Her friend Alana explains that she wanted to study for a Bachelor's degree in Aesthetics and that she submitted her resume to bars and shops, but she never got hired ; "when they saw I was trans, they discarded me."
> 
> It was then that, with no alternative, she began prostituting herself. She did this for several years as the only way to survive in Madrid, the city she moved to. "Even then, she didn't lose hope of modeling and signed up for courses to see if she could get hired for something else, but she had bad luck," Alana says.
> 
> Although Daniela's family no longer spoke to her, she continued to call. "They told her she could always return home as Juan, and she never accepted. She couldn't conceive of living a life other than her own, " says Alana, who describes her as an extraordinarily resilient person. But so many falls made her lose strength.
> 
> "They medicated her a lot, there were days when she couldn't get up until 11," says Xavi.
> On April 19, 2022, Kendall committed suicide in Santander, the city where her family lived at the time. Some time later, her friends began their battle for her dignity after her death. "Daniela was, is, and will be," they claim.                                                                                                                                                                   
> 
> Both Alana Pantaleón and Euforia Trans sent letters to the General Directorate of Equality in the Valencian Community in June 2023, to the Ombudsman, and to the Aspe city council. The letter holds their parents responsible and states that they had violated three different laws.
> 
>  However, despite being Daniela's chosen family, Alana is considered a nobody in the legal system, and only Kendall's parents, who rejected her, can file a complaint seeking restitution for her honor, something that several lawyers specializing in LGBT rights describe as a "legal absurdity."
> 
> The state of hate
> Daniela's story is not only that of a young woman broken by rejection, but also that of a society that still allows spaces where attempts are made to "correct" the identity of those who dissent. The State LGBTI Federation recently published its report "State of LGBTI Hate 2025," in which it warns that verbal attacks against members of the community have doubled in the last year , and that one in five people surveyed had experienced harassment. 
> 
> Discrimination in areas such as employment and housing still affects 25% of the population, especially trans people. The most alarming increase has been in attacks, which rose from 6% to 16% in one year. Paula Iglesias, president of the Federation, warned that "we are facing an alarming normalization of hatred, amplified by political discourse that legitimizes symbolic violence and paves the way for physical violence."
> 
> Daniela's name, erased from a tombstone, is an example of many other trans people who continue to be expelled from their homes, their schools, and their possible futures. Conversion therapies—prohibited in appearance, tolerated in practice—continue to leave invisible and profound scars, especially on trans lives, who often walk without a safety net, without family, and without a State to embrace them. Daniela's memory is not a remembrance: it is a warning. And also a flame.                         



> Justice The last battle of a trans woman: fighting for her honor after her death
> Her name prior to the registry change and a photograph prior to her transition mark the place where Daniela was buried. Her friends have started a process together with the Euforia Familias Trans Aliadas association against the administrations for her dignity. The case highlights the holes in the regulations to address transphobia.
> Daniela, also known as Kendall, in an image provided by her friends.
> 24 Oct 2023 06:00
> 
> Her name was Daniela and her closest people addressed her as Kendall, but there is no trace of those names in the inscription on her tombstone. There is also no trace of her de ella in the photograph of her de ella that her family de ella has chosen to remember her de ella after her death of ella in April 2022. 
> 
> “The name that appears on his tombstone is his deadname , a name with which he had not identified himself for a long time and which had changed legally,” explains his friend Alana Pantaleón, who believes that it is “an insult” that is the name. chosen to remember her. Regarding her photograph of her, she says that it is “a spit” to her memory of her. “She was a beautiful person inside and out, and she was happy with the change for which she had fought so hard, but what you see in the photograph is a gloomy, sad, uncomfortable boy,” she explains to El Salto.
> 
> Because Daniela was a trans girl, something that her family had never understood, much less accepted. “Her family knew and rejected Kendall's condition and this was the reason for the multiple abuses to which she was exposed,” explains Pantaleón, who considers that the name and photograph that the family has chosen to remember her are not only an insult but also a violation of her friend's right to honor.
> 
> When her friend wanted to take action to restore the honor of her friend, whom her family has identified as someone she is not, she found that only immediate family members were in a position to file a complaint.
> 
> That is why she decided to seek support to repair this right, a fight in which another friend of both of them accompanied her. The search took them to the Euforia Familias Trans Aliadas association. The road is not easy. Alana Pantaleón calls it “technical difficulties.” She found that, despite being the “chosen family” of her deceased woman, despite having lived with her friend and having accompanied her in recent years, in the legal system she is nobody. Daniela's friend found that only the direct relatives of the deceased were in a position to file a complaint to request reparation for her honor. 
> 
> Daniela's difficult path
> In the Guide to respectful accompaniment of trans identities in the family environment of Euforia Familias Trans Aliadas, this group that advises and accompanies trans people since 2019 - although with previous background - recommends listening to, accompanying and respecting a boy or girl who shows signs that his sexual identity is not cisnormative, and to do so without deciding for the creatures. He presents it as a legal and moral obligation to protect the people in his care, especially when they are young, and warns of the importance of providing a safe space to prevent behavioral disorders, depression, self-harm and suicidal thoughts.
> 
> But that is nothing like what Daniela experienced with her parents. Daniela was born in 2000 in Chile and was adopted in 2002 by a Spanish family residing in Cantabria. In 2011, at only 11 years old, she was already asking herself some questions about her orientation and identity: then, she defined herself to her family as a homosexual child, and she paid for it by being admitted to a psychiatric center, according to the information they have been able to obtain. gather your friends. 
> 
> A few years later, between 2013 and 2014, Daniela identified as a trans woman. The rejection of her parents, whom her friends define as conservative and very religious, intensified. In 2016, her family committed her to a psychiatric facility again.
> 
> The following year, in 2017, Daniela finally had access to specialized treatment. A confrontation with her family as a result of this process ends with the intervention of Social Services, and her parents lose guardianship in favor of a juvenile center, where she spends time until she comes of age.
> 
> When Daniela turned 18, she began her life outside the juvenile center, first in Torrelavega and then in Madrid, where she lived in her last years. There she got a job and started studying. There she requested the registration of the name change in the registry in 2021 and received confirmation of the change in March, as indicated by the documents compiled by her friends, although she did not manage to modify her DNI to transfer the change collected in register. In 2022, Daniela found herself in a borderline situation of precariousness and helplessness. She committed suicide in April of that year and was buried in the family niche in the Aspe cemetery, in Alicante.
> 
> Violation of three laws
> A letter addressed to the General Directorate of Equality of the Valencian Community in June 2023 exposes the violation of rights that using her old name and image in the Aspe cemetery would mean and asks that Daniela's honor be repaired. The text holds Daniela's parents responsible, but also the city council. The brief argues that violations included in three different laws had been committed.
> 
> Firstly, Law 23/2018, of November 29, on LGTBI equality, that is, the regional LGTBI law, which establishes as a serious infraction “the performance of acts or the imposition of provisions or clauses in businesses” would be violated. legal acts that constitute or cause discrimination based on gender identity or expression” as well as “performing acts that involve isolation, rejection or public and notorious contempt of people due to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, sexual development or group familiar".
> 
> The complaint letter addressed to the Equality Directorate of the Generalitat of Valencia considers that three laws have been violated: the regional LGTBI law, the Zerolo Law and the Municipal Burial Law.
> Secondly, the letter continues, it would violate Law 15/2022, of July 12, comprehensive for equal treatment and non-discrimination, known as the Zerolo Law, which recognizes the right of all people not to be discriminated against. due to orientation, sexual identity or gender expression, among other causes. This law considers acts or omissions that constitute discrimination as serious infractions and, the document argues, the facts presented about Daniela are discriminatory in the sense that she is treated less favorably than others in a similar situation. Serious infractions are punishable with fines of between 6,000 and 10,000 euros in the regional LGTBI law and between 10,000 and 40,000 in the Zerolo Law.
> 
> Thirdly, the document understands that Law 49/1978, of November 3, on burials in municipal cemeteries, which imposes an anti-discriminatory obligation on local corporations, would be violated: “City councils are obliged to ensure that burials are carried out in their cemeteries are carried out without any discrimination for reasons of religion or any other reason.”
> 
> The writing refers to Law 4/2023 for the real and effective equality of trans people and for the guarantee of the rights of LGTBI people, the Trans Law, which refers to regional laws when it comes to assessing possible infractions.
> 
> A legal absurdity
> “It is a case to which the regulations do not provide any type of response,” says Saúl Castro, an expert lawyer in the rights of LGTBIQ+ people, who has drafted the complaint.
> 
> The limitations begin in the Organic Law on Civil Protection of the Right to Honor, Personal and Family Intimacy, and One's Own Image, says the lawyer. Because this law is the most direct way to request through civil means the reparation of Daniela's right to honor. But the people entitled to make that request are “the spouse, descendants, ascendants and siblings of the affected person.”
> 
> “We find ourselves with the legal absurdity that the people who are harming the memory of a trans woman are the people whom our legal system recognizes as having the legitimacy to file a lawsuit,” Castro laments. The reading behind it, he continues, is that the system understands that the people who will look after the best interests when they have died are our biological families, something that does not always apply in the case of LGTBIQ+ people, where "the perpetrators can be our own family,” says the lawyer.
> 
> “The case is unique and raises many questions about how the right to honor and self-image can be guaranteed,” says the lawyer responsible for the complaint.
> Given this limitation, the complaint is supported in other ways: they resort to anti-discrimination regulations, specifically the Valencian LGTBI law and the Zerolo Law, despite the fact that in none of them there is a specific reference to the case, and they do so through the Euforia Trans Allied Families association.
> 
> This route, in addition to being less specific, is uncertain in terms of time: the lawyer recognizes that they cannot know in what terms the administration will respond, since the only reference they have is that of the statute of limitations of the facts that are reported. But, in that case, since discrimination occurs continuously, there is no prescription.
> 
> “The case is unique and raises many questions about how the right to honor and one's own image can be guaranteed; “It is the first time that it has been raised in the area of ??violence that happens to the LGTBI population,” he says.
> 
> The right to identity
> The right to name and gender expression is a manifestation of the right to one's own image linked to the dignity of the person. This is understood by the European Convention on Human Rights and other international texts. But it is also a constitutional principle, as stated, for example, in a 2019 ruling from this court, which interprets that, although the right to identity is not expressly included in the Constitution, “it can be considered tacitly included in article 10” — on the right to dignity of people—since “one's own identity, within which aspects such as name and sex are inscribed, is a main quality of the human person.” Another ruling, this one from 2022, recognizes sexual orientation and gender identity as “elements linked to the right to develop a certain private life” and within the framework of the right to “the physical and psychological integrity of a person.”
> 
> This idea is at the basis of the regional legislation that regulates the rights of trans people, as well as the Trans Law. In its preamble, this law recalls that the Constitutional Court established in a 2019 ruling that “one's own identity, within which aspects such as name and sex are included, is a main quality of the human person; Establishing one's own identity is not just another act of the person, but rather a vital decision, in the sense that it places the subject in a position to be able to develop his or her own personality."
> 
> A tribute to Kendall
> Daniela did have a fairer farewell than the one at the Aspe cemetery: the one they organized at the juvenile center where she lived until she was 18, this time with her name and real image. Some friends also got together on her birthday to remember her. 
> 
> “For us it is very important that it does not go unpunished and we believe that nothing is impossible,” says Natalia Aventín, president of Euforia Familias Trans Aliadas, who underlines the importance of the initiative that Daniela's friends have had and, in particular, the friend who has collected the data and has taken the initiative to promote the complaint. Because “we know that these things happen, but it is difficult to find someone to convey it to you or find a way to address it.”
> 
> Aventín regrets that the legitimation to repair the right to honor is left in the hands of families when many trans people encounter a direct refusal to recognize their identity. In contrast, it remembers the fundamental role of families when it comes to reading the signals that trans childhoods send, which are not only verbal but manifest themselves in different ways - in play or gender expression - and to which they ask to pay attention. attention from listening. “It is important to have an open mind and listen, because many times adults do not listen but rather we explain things all the time as if we were the only ones who can contribute something, we have to get rid of that adult-centrism,” he adds.
> 
> For Aventín, the case shows that there is much to do when it comes to the rights of trans people. An urgent change, he says, is that the legislation allows entities that fight for the collective to appear safely in the event of any violation of rights. 
> 
> The Aspe City Council, when asked by this newspaper, claims to have no record of any complaint, although it is aware of the facts since Euforia Familias Trans Aliadas contacted the council before filing the complaint with the Equality management. Euforia Trans Aliadas Families received a response from an Equality Technician, who told them that the corporation had decided not to act. Asked by this means, the City Council assures El Salto that it follows the legal procedures to facilitate the burial of deceased people for all families and that no administrative irregularity has been detected in the service. “If so, we would carry out the appropriate steps and procedures to correct the error,” they indicate. The Department of Social Services on which Equality depends, for its part, has not responded to this media's questions at the close of this article.
> 
> Pantaleón visited the niche where her friend's remains are located for the last time in August of this year. “She broke me, but I felt again that I had to do something, that this can't stay like this,” she explains. Daniela's friends are waiting for the response from the administrations and hope to be able to give her another farewell: “It would be nice if she could change and pay tribute to her, something more real,” says Pantaleón.
