> Dear friends and acquaintances
> I have the painful duty to inform you of Finn-Ann's passing.
> 
> Dr. Finn-Ann Magnin was a specialist in oral and implant surgery and, since May 1, 2020, an external senior physician at our clinic. Many of you probably knew her; she previously worked as Pierre Magnin at the Clinic for Oral Surgery and Stomatology.
> 
> Finn-Ann enriched our clinic with her commitment, courage, and determination, strengthened our experienced implant team, and actively supported and advanced our assistants in their continuing education.
> 
> We will miss her, but will always remember her fondly and remember her with honor.
> Finn-Ann has traveled a very difficult and rocky path for herself. She built so much, then tore it down, and left it behind. She had to face many obstacles and yet overcome so many.
> 
> The final hurdles, well, they were unfortunately too high.
> 
> However, we are convinced that Finn-Ann is doing well wherever she is. Our thoughts are with her on her final journey, and we wish her soul the wings of freedom.
> 
> We offer our sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to the bereaved family and loved ones.
