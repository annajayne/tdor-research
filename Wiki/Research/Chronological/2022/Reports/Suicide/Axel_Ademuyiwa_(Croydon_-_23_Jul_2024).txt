> The death of a trans child who ingested a lethal substance bought online will be investigated by a coroner in South London. Axel Ademuyiwa was just 17-years-old when he took his own life using the deadly chemical on July 23, 2022.
> 
> Axel's parents continue to refer to him by his birth name, but the death is expected to be registered with his chosen name.
> 
> The substance - which MyLondon has chosen not to name - is one the National Crime Agency has linked to 272 packages and at least 90 deaths in the UK through 57-year-old Canadian 'poison killer' Kenneth Law, BBC News reports. Mr Law, from Toronto, is set to go on trial for 14 first-degree murder charges and 14 charges of aiding and abetting suicide at a court in Ontario in September 2025.
> 
> At Croydon Coroners Court on Wednesday, August 28, a lawyer acting for the NHS mentioned Mr Law by name in the context of the child's death, and said 'there may be an issue with the police' due to the ongoing prosecution. Mr Law's was referred to several times during the hearing, but he was not explicitly confirmed as the chemical seller.
> 
> anadian detectives say Mr Law ran a number of websites offering equipment and substances to help people end their lives. Police believe he may have sent more than 1,200 parcels containing lethal substances to around 40 countries. In February, Mr Law's lawyer, Matthew Gourlay, told BBC News his client intends to plead not guilty to the 28 charges against him.
> 
> On Wednesday, Assistant Coroner John Taylor said Axel's acquisition of the substance could be in the scope of the full inquest. He also revealed he was meeting with police detectives to discuss the latest developments in their investigation this week.
> 
> After hearing submissions about the redaction of documents and the timetable for witness statements, Mr Taylor reminded interested parties the inquest would not be a public enquiry into the wider capacity of the NHS to treat patients.
> 
> "The central issues will be those which had a direct bearing on [Axel's] mental state at the time," said Mr Taylor, adding: "How did they get themselves in that position and how did his death come about."
> 
> During submissions, an NHS lawyer opposed the full release of Axel's phone download to his parents, arguing only relevant material should be shared in the interest of his privacy.
> 
> "A teenager's phone is very particular to them," she added.
> 
> The pre-inquest review heard from lawyers for Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust. Lawyers from the London Borough of Bexley, where Axel died, and Social Care Limited were also present.
