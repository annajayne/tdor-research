> We remember Dominique Courts
> _____
> memories from Dom Chatterjee:
> Dom Courts and I started in-person peer support groups for QTPoC together at Brooklyn Community Pride Center in 2015, along with other founding members, and they were a moderator of the related Facebook group for several years.
> My life hasn’t been the same since October 2022. It took 2 Dominique Cs to start this thing, and now there’s 1 left. We're both Capricorns too and did a lot of work connecting people who were otherwise isolated and quietly suffering. 
> If Dom hadn’t spoken up about the impact of white supremacy silencing her in mental health spaces, thousands of us wouldn’t have received care through QTPoC Mental Health.
> You are loved, Dom. You are remembered.
