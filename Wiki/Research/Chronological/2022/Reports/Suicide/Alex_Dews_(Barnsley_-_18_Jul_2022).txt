> Alex Dews died at the age of 13.
> 
> A coroner has found there were individual failings to follow support processes at a school attended by a trans teenager who died after telling staff he wanted to kill himself, but said there was no "systemic failure".
> 
> The family of 13-year-old Alex Dews told an inquest earlier this year he was "crying out for help and was disregarded" while he was a Year 8 pupil at Outwood Academy Shafton, in Barnsley.
> 
> On Thursday, assistant coroner Abigail Combes told the resumed inquest: "I'm satisfied that there are processes in place.
> 
> "There are absolutely identifiable individual failures of following those processes.
> 
> "These are not sufficient to amount to systemic failure."
> 
> The coroner said she was "slightly horrified" that the school was left to make crucial decisions about which services to refer Alex to in order make sure he had the right support.
> 
> Ms Combes said she had been told how a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) was not made until three weeks before Alex died because the school's past experience was that the waiting list was so long and CAMHS would remove children from this list if they were accessing services elsewhere.
> 
> She said: "This is not a position a school should be in".
> 
> The hearing at Sheffield Coroner's Court heard how Alex was found with serious injuries in a park in Barnsley in July 2022 and died in hospital four days later.
> 
> Earlier this year, Alex's family described how he had told them he wanted to change his name and identify as male after going to secondary school, and Outwood Shafton put him on its vulnerable register.
> 
> The coroner described how the teenager self-harmed in school in November 2021 - an incident which she said was not properly recorded by the school and should have triggered a risk assessment.
> 
> Alex made further disclosures about self-harm to a support service and, in March 2022, he wrote a letter seen by a teacher indicating that he wanted to end his life.
> 
> This triggered an accelerated referral by the school to the iSpace counselling service, in Barnsley.
> 
> The coroner noted that Alex began counselling and, at his second session, disclosed that he had attempted an overdose.
> 
> She said that he also told the deputy safeguarding lead at the school that he wanted to end his life.
> 
> The court heard that the iSpace sessions ended in May 2022 and, although a handover suggested further engagement might be useful in the future, there was no detail and no follow-up.
> 
> The coroner noted that despite there being evidence of a deterioration in Alex's behaviour at school, there were no further incidents of self harm or expression of suicidal intent and the school could not have assumed "there was a real or immediate threat to Alex's life".
> 
> Ms Combes said the school eventually decided to make a referral to CAMHS in June but this was about putting in place support for the next school year rather than an immediate fear for his life.
> 
> She said that, if staff had feared for Alex's immediate safety, they probably would have chosen another service rather than CAMHS.
> 
> The coroner said she will be writing a 'prevention of future deaths report' to organisations including the Department of Health and Social Care, about her concerns over the way referrals are made to CAMHS.
> 
> She said she also had concerns about the way schools and counselling services share information.
> 
> Ms Combes said she did not have enough evidence to conclude that Alex died as a result of suicide and recorded a narrative conclusion.
> 
> She said she did not know if Alex deliberately intended to end his life when he took the steps he did in the park.
> 
> Alex’s grandmother, Susan, told the inquest earlier this year: “What has happened to us has ripped us all apart and no amount of words will ever explain the emptiness and amount of pain we feel.”
> 
> In a statement written by Mrs Dews on behalf all the family and read to the court, she said: “He was not just some troubled teen, not a number lost in a system, but a scared child, struggling to come to terms with his own gender and how he could fit into society, how he was crying out for help and was disregarded.
> 
> “How he was let down and how we are now left trying to pick up the pieces of our shattered life.”
> 
> Mrs Dews said the family realised after Alex went to secondary school that “he had been battling with his own body since, the age of three”.
> 
> She described how he told his family he was transgender and how he had chosen a new name.
> 
> She said: “I would have accepted Alex no matter what he was. He was my grandson, and it did not matter what name or genitalia he had. We loved him no matter what.”
> 
> Mrs Dews said: “The school did very little to build any sort of rapport or understanding of Alex during the difficult time he was going through. It almost felt that as they were not used to this type of situation, it was sort of brushed to one side.”
> 
> She said: “Alex wasn’t a troubled teenager going through a fashion phase, he was a child screaming out for help and no-one would listen or offer us the help he needed.
> 
> “I just feel let down and that Alex was failed despite every attempt to get help and every cry for help that went un-listened to an unacted on.”



> A coroner said she intends to call for a review of the way mental health referrals are made by schools following the death of a transgender teenager.
> 
> Alex Dews, 13, from Barnsley, died in hospital on 18 July 2022, four days after he was found seriously injured in a country park.
> 
> An inquest heard that before his death he had told staff at his school he wanted to kill himself.
> 
> Coroner Abigail Combes said there were "issues that need resolving".
> 
> The resumed inquest in Sheffield heard Alex had expressed the wish to identify as male after starting at Outwood Academy Shafton and he had been placed on the school's vulnerable list.
> 
> Later that month the coroner said Alex had self harmed at school, but that the incident, which should have triggered a risk assessment, but was not properly logged.
> 
> Outwood Academy executive principal Cara Ackroyd told the court this was the type of incident she would "usually" expect to be recorded by staff.
> 
> Following this, another self-harming incident was disclosed, which resulted in Alex being placed on the waiting list for mental health support iSpace.
> 
> Then in March 2022, Alex wrote a note to his teacher, expressing thoughts of suicide.
> 
> As a result, he was bumped up the risk register and iSpace waiting list, and later that month began six weeks of counselling.
> 
> The coroner noted that Alex began counselling and, at his second session, disclosed that he had attempted an overdose.
> 
> She said that he also told the deputy safeguarding lead at the school that he wanted to end his life.
> 
> The inquest heard the school did not make a referral to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) due to concerns Alex would be removed from the waiting list as he had already been receiving iSpace support.
> 
> After the iSpace sessions ended in May 2022, although a handover suggested further engagement might be useful in the future, there was no detail and no follow-up.
> 
> The coroner noted that despite there being evidence of a deterioration in Alex's behaviour at school, there were no further incidents of self-harm or expression of suicidal intent and the school could not have assumed "there was a real or immediate threat to Alex's life".
> 
> Ms Combes said the school eventually decided to make a referral to CAMHS in June but this was about putting in place support for the next school year rather than an immediate fear for his life.
> 
> Recording a narrative conclusion Ms Combes said while she was "satisfied that there are processes in place... there are absolutely identifiable individual failures of following those processes [though] these are not sufficient to amount to systemic failure".
> 
> She said she would be writing a prevention of future deaths report to organisations, including the Department of Health and Social Care, about her concerns over the way referrals are made to CAMHS, saying she had been left "slightly horrified" the school was left to make crucial decisions about which services to refer Alex to.
> 
> She said she also had concerns about the way schools and counselling services share information.
> 
> Addressing the family, she said: "I know that the conclusion I've reached is not quite the view you hold but I hope you understand why I've reached that conclusion.
> 
> "I can absolutely see that there are issues that need resolving."
> 
> Paying tribute to her grandson during the earlier hearing in June, Susan Dews said Alex "would always be here with us".
> 
> Her statement read: "We have all got so many good memories of our time spent with Alex and these memories will always be talked and laughed about and we will be making new memories for him."
> 
> The BBC has approached Outwood Academy for comment.




> Death of trans teen sparks call for review of school mental health referral
> A coroner says she will call for a review of how schools make mental health referrals after the tragic death of a trans teenager in 2022.
> 
> Alex Dews, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was found seriously injured in a park and died in hospital four days later on July 18, 2022. His family explained that the teenager had been “crying for help” from his school. He was just 13 years old.
> 
> Coroner Abigail Combes found that while there were “individual failures” in the way support processes were followed at the school Alex attended, there was no evidence of a “systemic failure”, the BBC reported.
> 
> An inquest into the teenager's death earlier this year found Dews told staff at Outwood Academy Shafton in Barnsley that he was feeling suicidal in the months before his death.
> 
> His family explained that Dews had told them he wanted to change his name after coming out as a transgender child, and that his school then included his name on its vulnerable registry.
> 
> Later that month, the 13-year-old boy was reported to have self-harmed while at school; however, the incident was not properly recorded, even though it warranted a risk assessment.
> 
> Dews was reportedly placed on the waitlist for mental health support at iSpace, and began six weeks of counseling in March 2022 after expressing suicidal thoughts to a teacher earlier that month.
> 
> iSpace sessions reportedly ended in May 2022, and while a handover suggested greater mental health support, it was not followed up.
> 
> The inquest heard that Outwood Academy did not refer Alex to NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) due to concerns he would be removed from the waiting list because he was already receiving support from iSpace.
> 
> Combes explained at the inquest resumed at Sheffield Coroner's Court on Thursday (September 7) that the school had subsequently referred to CAMHS in June 2022 to provide support for Alex during the next school year, and that the school could not have assumed that "there was a real or immediate threat to Alex's life", since he had no more cases of self-harm.
> 
> He said that he did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that Alex had died as a result of suicide.
> 
> “I am pleased that there are processes underway,” Combes said in a narrative conclusion.
> 
> “There are absolutely identifiable individual failures in the monitoring of these processes… they are not enough to amount to a systemic failure.”
> 
> Combes said she was “a bit horrified” that vital decisions about which services to refer Dews to were left in the hands of her school, and that she would be writing a report on preventing future deaths for organisations, including the Department of Health and Social Care. about concerns related to how referrals are made to CAMHS.
> 
> He also expressed concern about the exchange of information between schools and counseling services.
> 
> Alex Dews' grandmother, Susan Dews, told an inquest in June: “What has happened to us has broken us all and no amount of words can explain the emptiness and amount of pain we feel.
> 
> “He wasn't just a troubled teenager, not just a lost number in a system, but a scared child, struggling to accept his own gender and how he could fit into society, how he cried out for help and was ignored.
> 
> “How they let him down and how we are now left trying to pick up the pieces of our shattered life.”
