> Trans youth dying in suicide "epidemic" as UK increasingly restricts gender-affirming care
>
> Transgender 15-year-old Jason Pulman died by suicide after his country’s medical system told him he’d have to wait 26 months for his first gender-affirming care appointment. His death is at least the third to occur among trans teens in the U.K. who were recently denied similar care — advocates worry such deaths will only increase now that the U.K. seems likely to further restrict such care.
> 
> A five-day judicial inquiry at Hastings Coroner’s Court in the east English county of East Sussex has found that Pulman, a trans boy, began self-harming at age 13. He came out as trans at age 14, and in February 2020, his doctor referred him to the U.K. National Health Service’s (NHS) Tavistock Clinic for youth Gender Identity Development Services.
> 
> However, when Pulman followed up with the clinic that following October, he learned that he’d have to wait 26 months for his first appointment, The Independent reported.
> 
> In the following months, Pulman’s stepfather, Mark Pulman, said the teen had “given up” on his family and himself and began using drugs and alcohol. His mother, Emily Pulman, said he struggled with his gender dysphoria as well as his relationships and friends.
> 
> “In his world, that was the answer, in his world we don’t know whether that was the whole answer, but to him that appointment was everything,” his stepfather said.
> 
> Emily Pulman added, “My son died a lost boy because he was so confused by the end that he didn’t know what he was or what he was doing. He was driving himself crazy waiting for that appointment because when was it coming? When was he going to get help? He was just waiting for it all to make sense, he had so much confusion going on in his head.”
> 
> Pulman’s family last saw him on the evening of April 18, 2022. The next morning, they found his bedroom door tied shut and the window open. They repeatedly contacted the police, but the police made them wait for hours before responding. Police classified his being missing as a “medium-risk” concern because there was “nothing to suggest immediate risk of suicide.” An hour later — on April 19, 2022 — he took his own life in an East Sussex park. The nearby suicide note read, “I’m sorry, mum.”
> 
> “Jason’s emotional and mental health needs were inadequately assessed and provided for,” a jury at the aforementioned court ruled this week, declaring that both the police and NHS inadequately handled the teenager’s needs. The medical clinic that referred him to Tavistock made no note of his history of self-harm, submitted his referral on a medical form meant for adult patients, and didn’t show Pulman’s general practitioner before submitting the form (even though the doctor’s name appeared on it), The Telegraph reported.
> 
> “Systemic communication and administrative failures by all of the organizations involved in his care… may possibly have been contributing factors,” the court ruled. Both the police force and NHS have issued apologies, the BBC reported.
> 
> The U.K.’s restrictions on gender-affirming care are expected to worsen as the NHS recently closed the over-burdened Tavistock clinic. While 210 trans youth were referred to Tavistock’s GIDS from 2011 to 2012, that number rose to 3,500 referrals in 2021 and 2022, Pink News reported. The NHS also recently ordered all adult clinics to deny services to any clients younger than 18 and also told clinics to stop prescribing puberty blockers to minors, leaving many without a way to quickly receive care.
> 
> The NHS’ orders follow the recent release of the Cass Review, a 400-page review of oft-cited research on gender-affirming care for minors. The review concluded that there’s little reliable evidence showing positive outcomes from such care, but outraged trans activists say it excluded hundreds of studies showing such outcomes.
> 
> Trans rights advocates worry the Cass Review will give conservative political leaders a pretext for ending gender-affirming care for minors and younger adults. Indeed, the review urged “extreme caution” before giving minors puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy and championed the use of psychological therapy instead. The review also said that “life-changing” decisions on gender-affirming care should be put off until adulthood since the brain continues maturing into age 26.
> 
> Every major medical and mental health association in the U.S. has endorsed gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers, as evidence-based, safe, and necessary for the treatment of gender dysphoria in young people.
> 
> “There has been an epidemic of suicides in the UK of trans youth as a result of care being restricted,” queer civil rights lawyer Alejandra Caraballo recently wrote via X. She cited recent media reports of Alice Litman, a 20-year-old trans woman who died by suicide after spending 1,000 days on NHS waiting lists, as well as Charlie Miller, a 17-year-old trans boy who died by suicide after being denied medical care due to his other alleged mental illnesses.
> 
> Pulman’s mother said, “We hope CAMHS [Counseling and Mental Health Services] will be properly resourced. We hope the police will learn how to risk assess, and not set the bar too high… Above all, we hope the government will stop toxifying this whole issue, and just look at the children.”
> 
> “He was a kid that wanted to change the world, that wanted to fight for causes he believed in… He was just so genuine and just wanted everyone to be happy and feel comfortable, which is what he wanted as well.”




>  MEDIA  MEDIA RELEASES
> Jason Pulman: Inquest finds systemic failures by organisations involved in trans teen's care possibly contributed to death
> 12 April 2024
> 
> Before HM Assistant Coroner Michael Spencer
> Hastings Coroner’s Court
> 8 – 12 April 2024
> 
> Jason Pulman, a 15 year old transgender teenager died a self-inflicted death on 19 April 2022 in East Sussex. His family had reported him missing earlier that day. Now an inquest has found that Jason died by suicide. The jury found that gender dysphoria was a contributing cause to his death. 
> 
> The jury found that systemic communication and administrative failures by all of the organisations involved in his care, with the exception of his school, possibly contributed to his death. They also concluded Sussex Police responded inadequately to the family’s missing person report and that a referral to British Transport Police might have prevented his death.
> 
> Jason was the eldest of five siblings. A talented artist, Jason fought for every cause he believed in. His family said he ‘loved all the silliness in the world and using it to make all those around him smile.’
> 
> Jason was known to social services his entire life. He had a complex history of trauma and mental ill health, including serious self-harm, an overdose and substance misuse.
> 
> In February 2020, Jason’s GP had referred Jason into the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS). Child and Adult Mental Health Services (CAMHS) subsequently re-referred Jason into GIDS in March 2021. At the time of his death, Jason remained on the waiting list for gender affirming healthcare. 
> 
> During the start of the Coronavirus pandemic, Jason’s mental health further deteriorated and his self-harm intensified. 
> 
> Jason received on and off support from CAMHS and social services. Jason took an overdose in late September 2021.  However, the following month CAMHS discharged Jason for the final time. 
> 
> The inquest heard evidence that the multidisciplinary team meeting which considered providing Jason with CAMHS care for the last time was not adequately documented prior to him being discharged. The person who conducted the final assessment also said that “the learning” she took away, was Jason should have received therapy. 
> 
> The jury heard that Jason’s mental health continued to deteriorate throughout 2022.
> 
> In March 2022, Jason’s school made a safeguarding referral to social services due to concerns shared between Jason’s family and the school. Jason was subsequently due to meet with a social worker on 31 April 2022. The inquest heard evidence that this referral should have been picked up by CAMHS as well as social care and the reason why this did not happen is not known.
> 
> On the morning of 19 April, Jason’s family found his room empty. The family called Sussex Police for the first time at 09:30 and gave information including the following:
> 
> Jason was a child of 15;
> He had a history of trauma, self-harm and one known recent suicide attempt;
> He had problems with his mental health, and was on the GIDS waiting list;
> This was out of character behaviour and he had never gone missing before;
> He was known to misuse drugs and alcohol;
> There was a court order preventing contact with his biological father, who was known to the police;
> He was frail, small and vulnerable. 
> 
> The jury heard evidence that the information given in the initial 999 call by Jason’s mother was not properly transcribed by the initial call handler, only stating that Jason had no suicidal intent, and was graded medium risk. This was relied on by officers later dealing with the case, who never checked whether this summary was accurate.
> 
> Jason’s case was eventually looked at by the duty sergeant at 13:21, who maintained the medium risk rating. No further work or reassessment was done on the case until the late shift.
> 
> Jason’s family called the police a total of five times on the day, providing updates they had received from the public and reiterating their concern that Jason was going to take his own life. Despite this, an officer only attended the home address at 19:30.
> 
> The jury heard evidence that the duty sergeant on the late shift would have sent out an alert to British Transport Police if he had looked at what Jason’s mother was saying. This was only done at 18:20, when Jason had been missing for approximately 20 hours. No officers contacted the family at all until the attendance at 19:30
> 
> Tragically, Jason was stopped by a Southeastern Railway Revenue Protection Officer and handed a penalty fare at 17:37. The inquest heard evidence from that officer that he would have stopped Jason had he been aware he was a missing child. There was a further opportunity missed when Jason waited at Ashford International station, before boarding a train for the last time.
> 
> At around 20:35, Jason was found by a member of the public, having ligatured in a park. 
> 
> The jury concluded that Jason died through suicide, with gender dysphoria as a contributing medical cause. They found that:
> 
> Jason's emotional and mental health needs were inadequately assessed and provided for
> Systemic communication and administrative failures by all of the organisations involved in his care, with the exception of Bexhill College, may possibly have been contributing factors.
> In particular, the police responded inadequately to the missing person's report and failed to keep the family informed, bearing in mind Jason was a child with a history of complex needs.
> A referral to British Transport Police might have prevented Jason’s death.
> 
> Emily and Mark Pulman, Jason’s mother and stepfather said: “No parent should ever lose a child, and to lose Jason in the way we did, we will leave others to imagine. The jury has found that it might have been prevented, and we will just have to find a way of living with that. We just hope the lessons will be learned.
> 
> We hope CAMHS will be properly resourced. We hope the police will learn how to risk assess, and not set the bar too high. And this week, above all, we hope the government will stop toxifying this whole issue, and just look at the children.”
> 
> Jodie Anderson, senior caseworker at INQUEST, said: “Jason’s inquest comes at a crucial time when the rights of young transgender people are being rolled back. A lack of access to gender affirming healthcare was a source of distress for Jason, as it will be for thousands of others who are now left stranded. 
> 
> Meanwhile referrals to CAMHS have increased exponentially over the last decade and a chronic under resourcing leaves children like Jason without any quality therapeutic care for their mental health needs. 
> 
> We are at crisis point. How many more families will be left devastated, dealing with the loss of a child in such traumatic circumstances?”
>
