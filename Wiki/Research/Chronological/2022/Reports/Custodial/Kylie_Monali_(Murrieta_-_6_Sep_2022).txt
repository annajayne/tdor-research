> Trans Woman Killed in 2022 While Incarcerated, Family Files Lawsuit
> September 17, 2023 by Sue
> Kylie Monali trans woman
> Via HRC
> The murder of a 41-year-old Nepali trans woman incarcerated in California in 2022 has come to light after her parents filed a lawsuit against the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.
> 
> From HRC, I learned that Kylie Monali was a 41-year-old trans woman who, according to news sources, was killed in prison by her cellmate on September 7, 2022.
> 
> The suit alleges that Kylie was inappropriately housed with a violent cellmate who was a registered sex offender, putting her in jeopardy.
> 
> According to the suit, Kylie’s 61-year-old cellmate beat her for 68 minutes until she died. According to the suit, jail staff did not conduct a routine check of the cells as required by their internal policy, only discovering Kylie’s death when other inmates raised the alarm.
> 
> Born and raised in Nepal, Kylie completed her O-Levels from The Kathmandu Academy. She came to the US on a F1 student visa at the New College of California in San Francisco in 2002. At the time of her death, she was incarcerated for her participation in a 2008 murder.
> 
> Still, she didn’t deserve to be executed by another inmate. It wasn’t ‘jail justice’ – it was a brutal assault and murder. The decisions of the people responsible for her care sent a horrifying message to all trans people in the prison industrial complex, right?
> 
> Again, according to HRC
> 
> Kylie’s parents are suing the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, alleging failures by several of its leaders and deputies allowed her to be killed by her cellmate. The suit states that the department acted negligently and in violation of both U.S. Constitution and state laws by allowing Kylie to be housed in a cell with a convicted sex offender who had a history of violent behavior. The suit states that sheriff’s personnel knew Kylie’s cellmate posed an imminent threat to Kylie, who was particularly vulnerable because she was transgender and HIV-positive, and yet the sheriff’s department allowed the two to be housed together at the Cois Byrd Detention Center in Murrieta. The suspect in Kylie’s death faces additional homicide charges, and remains in custody.
> 
> The new court case, filed Friday in federal court, adds to the many similar suits over inmate deaths that have been recently against the department, which is also being investigated by the state attorney general over the deaths and other allegations of misconduct and civil rights violations.
> 
> Kylie is the 41st transgender person killed in the year 2022. Her death is the 13th reported death during 2023. She is the 33rd person of color from these neighbors respectively. She is the 30th woman of color from these neighbors. For the entire year of 2021, victims include 21 Black trans women, 5 Latinx trans women, 3 AAIPI trans women, 1 Native/Indigenous person, 2 white trans women, 3 Black trans man and 3 white trans men. The youngest was 15, the oldest was 50. Twelve were 25 or younger. Their deaths camee on the heels of 2021, the most violent year in recorded history with the deaths of 57 trans, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people in the United States alone.
> 
> Kylie was in the custody of the state and they have an obligation to keep her safe while she remained there. The heinous nature of her alleged crimes (she was due to be retried soon after her death) do not diminish the heinous nature of her murder. I have a hard time understanding why ANYONE would share a cell with a violent repeat sexual predator. We have to ensure trans folx are safe when in any type of state custody.
> 
> Rest in power, Kylie. Your family seeks justice in your name. I am sorry the system failed you. I am sorry that we failed you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.


> Remembering Kylie Monali, Transgender Woman Killed in Murrieta, California
> by Jarred Keller • September 13, 2023
> 
> Kylie Monali was a 41-year-old trans woman who, according to news sources, was killed in prison by her cellmate on September 7, 2022. Monali’s death was one of 40 violent killings of a transgender or gender non-conforming person in 2022. We say “at least” because too often these deaths go misreported — or unreported.
> 
> “Although we are deeply saddened by Kylie’s death, we choose to find comfort in knowing that her killer is being held responsible for his heinous actions. Far too often trans people are treated as though our lives don’t matter and it’s the queer community’s duty to stand up in the face of injustice for trans people everywhere. We must uplift Kylie’s life and demand justice for her death,” said Tori Cooper, Human Rights Campaign Director of Community Engagement for the Transgender Justice Initiative.
> 
> Kylie’s parents are suing the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, alleging failures by several of its leaders and deputies allowed her to be killed by her cellmate. The suit states that the department acted negligently and in violation of both U.S. Constitution and state laws by allowing Kylie to be housed in a cell with a convicted sex offender who had a history of violent behavior. The suit states that sheriff’s personnel knew Kylie’s cellmate posed an imminent threat to Kylie, who was particularly vulnerable because she was transgender and HIV-positive, and yet the sheriff's department allowed the two to be housed together at the Cois Byrd Detention Center in Murrieta. The suspect in Kylie’s death faces additional homicide charges, and remains in custody.
> 
> In an injustice compounding this tragedy, Kylie was misgendered in some media and police reports. Anti-transgender stigma is exacerbated by callous or disrespectful treatment by some in the media, law enforcement and elected offices. According to HRC research, it is estimated that approximately three-quarters of all known victims were misgendered by the media and/or by law enforcement. In the pursuit of greater accuracy and respect, HRC offers guidelines for journalists and others who report on transgender people. HRC, Media Matters and the Trans Journalists Association have also partnered on an FAQ for reporters writing about anti-trans violence.
> 
> At the state level, transgender and gender non-conforming people in California are explicitly protected from discrimination in employment, housing, education and public spaces. California does include sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected characteristic in its hate crimes law. Though we have recently seen some political gains that support and affirm transgender people, we have also faced unprecedented anti-LGBTQ+ attacks in the states. During the most recent legislative session, more than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were under consideration in state legislatures across the country, over 200 of which directly targeted transgender people. As of this writing, over 80 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been signed into law – more than any other year on record.
> 
> We must demand better from our elected officials and reject harmful anti-transgender legislation at the local, state and federal levels, while also considering every possible way to make ending this violence a reality. It is clear that fatal violence disproportionately affects transgender women of color, especially Black transgender women. The intersections of racism, transphobia, sexism, biphobia and homophobia conspire to deprive them of necessities to live and thrive, so we must all work together to cultivate acceptance, reject hate and end stigma for everyone in the trans and gender non-conforming community.


> Lawsuit: Transgender inmate killed after sheriff made a violent sex offender her cellmate
> String of lawsuits follows record number of jail deaths in county last year
> PAUL ALBANI-BURGIO   Palm Springs Desert Sun
> 9 hours ago
> The parents of a woman who was beaten to death at a county jail last year are suing the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, alleging failures by several of its leaders and deputies allowed her to be killed by her cellmate.
> 
> Chief among the failures, the lawsuit says: Deputies gave Kaushal Niroula, who was transgender, a sex offender cellmate with a violent past.
> 
> The new filing adds to the cascade of similar suits over inmate deaths that have been recently against the department, which is also being investigated by the state attorney general over the deaths and other allegations of misconduct and civil rights violations.
> 
> A record 18 inmates died in the jails in 2022.
> 
> The suit states that the department acted negligently and in violation of both the constitution and state law by allowing Niroula to be housed in a cell with Ronald Sanchez, a man who was a convicted sex offender and had a history of violent behavior. The sheriff's department manages all jails in Riverside County.
> 
> The suit states that sheriff’s personnel knew Sanchez posed an imminent threat to Niroula, who was particularly vulnerable because she was transgender and HIV-positive, and yet the sheriff's department allowed the two to be housed together at the Cois Byrd Detention Center in Murrieta.
> 
> Niroula, who was 41, was in jail because she had been charged with being a part of a group of people that attacked and killed 74-year-old Clifford Lambert at his Palm Springs home in 2008.
> 
> The Cois M. Byrd Detention Center in Murrieta in one of five jails operated by the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. The department agreed to reduce the facility's 1,100 inmate capacity by about 40 to ensure inmates and staff are able to social distance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
> The Cois M. Byrd Detention Center in Murrieta in one of five jails operated by the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.  
> COURTESY OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
> Niroula’s death was announced by the sheriff’s department on Sept. 7 of last year, one day after she died. The department said at the time that Niroula died after getting into a confrontation with Sanchez, who was 61.
> 
> The suit, which cites the coroner’s investigation into Niroula’s death, states that surveillance video shows the door of the shared cell being closed from the inside at the time the attack is believed to have happened. The video also shows multiple inmates who walked up to or near the cell and are believed to have been aware a beating was taking place. The suit alleges that the video shows Sanchez high fiving and shaking hands with other inmates shortly after the attack.
> 
> The suit also states that no jail staff came to check on Niroula while she was being beaten for 68 minutes, despite having an obligation to conduct cell safety checks once every hour and protect inmates from violence more generally. Attorney Denisse O. Gastélum also writes that jail staff only came to the cell after being summoned by inmates and that Niroula was dead by the time they arrived.
> 
> The complaint notes Niroula was killed just three days before her trial was set to begin. Gastélum alleges in the complaint that the family has learned Niroula had been assisting state and federal investigators looking into illegal wiretapping at the jail.
> 
> “Upon information and belief, the brutal and violent assault of Ms. Niroula had been planned for some time and was a coordinated effort of both inmates and staff,” Gastélum wrote.
> 
> The suit, filed on behalf of Niroula's estate by her parents, Radha Niroula and Krishna Niroula, seeks unspecified damages. It cites 11 causes of action, including the failures to protect Niroula from harm, to provide medical care to her as required under the constitution and to hire and train sheriff’s staff who would enforce policies protecting Niroula from harm.
> 
> Among those named in the suit is Sheriff Chad Bianco and two other jail officials who the suit states “acted with deliberate indifference, gross negligence and reckless disregard of the safety, security, protection and constititutional and statutory rights of decedent Kaushal Niroula and all other persons similarly situated."
> 
> The suit is at least the fifth to be filed this year by people alleging that the deaths of their family members in Riverside County jails could’ve been prevented  by the sheriff’s department.
