Unidad N° 22 de Florencio Varela
Florencio Varela
Buenos Aires
clinical neglect


> Published on 11/21/24
> 
> In the Diversity Ward of Prison Unit No. 32 in Florencio Varela, a dense atmosphere pervades. There is concern and anger among the inmates of Mónica Mego Velayarse , a trans woman who has suffered from unbearable lower back pain for over three months. Her days in prison have become a torment marked by sharp pains in her back and a tingling sensation in her legs that now prevents her from standing or walking normally. Although she repeatedly sought medical attention, her requests were dismissed, and she only managed to get a few ibuprofen pills. It's February 2019, and Mónica can't stand . She moves almost by crawling, and as she does, the Penitentiary Service officers mock her. Her inmates are acting in solidarity and, to draw attention to the situation, are declaring a hunger strike until Mónica receives professional assistance.
> 
> More than five years have passed since that scene in the prison. Mónica Mego was acquitted at the end of 2021 on the grounds of "natural punishment ," as the court ruled that the health conditions she suffered in prison constituted a sufficient sentence, exceeding any prison term that could have been imposed. Accused of the alleged crime of drug possession for sale (which carries a sentence of 4 to 15 years), she had spent more than three years in pretrial detention and two years of paraplegia. Finally, Mónica died on March 10, 2022, at the age of 36. She had been acquitted just three months earlier.
> 
> The Assistant Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Occurring in Prison Units of the La Plata Judicial Department has determined that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute seven Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service officers . Juan Manuel González, Walter Raúl Piñón, Matías Pérez Núñez, Francisco Artola, Claudio Piccin, Elvira Tucto, and María Guzmán are charged in the criminal case investigating their responsibilities in obstructing Mónica's access to healthcare . The charges include "neglectful abandonment of a person, serious injuries, and negligent injuries ." This means that the Justice Department is not investigating the death itself, but rather the actions of these prison officers and doctors while Mónica was detained and was not guaranteed her right to adequate medical care. In other words, this is a clear case of institutional violence , the victim of which was a trans woman who saw her body and health deteriorate without being able to do anything to save herself. 
> 
> Narrating violence in the first person
> Violence is part of the DNA of penitentiary institutions. According to data provided by the Attorney General's Office of the Province of Buenos Aires, between 2014 and 2022, 34,132 cases were initiated for situations of institutional violence. Half of the reported cases occurred in prisons and police stations . 
> 
> Although it received little media coverage, Mónica's story had a significant judicial impact thanks to actions taken by LGBTTIQ+ rights activists alongside the Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM), which acted as a private party in the case. One of the strategies was to incorporate statements from expert witnesses to explain to the courts what it means to be a trans person in a patriarchal society, and particularly in contexts of confinement. The voices of social psychologist and trans activist Marlene Wayar and anthropologist Josefina Fernández attempted to echo the courts' sounding board, so that this time they would not fall on deaf ears. 
> 
> Amaris Lascano , a lawyer and activist following the case, believes Mónica's case is paradigmatic. Speaking with Perycia , she noted: "What's new is that in the Province of Buenos Aires, it's never happened before that experts based on their own knowledge testify in a case involving a transvestite or trans person . And they've also done so during the investigation stage. In Argentina, it's only happened in the Diana Sacayán case," and then only at the trial stage.
> 
> Formal advances in the rights of trans and transvestite people are far from guaranteeing their real exercise within the prison system. The discriminatory treatment, punishments and harassment, humiliation, and denigration suffered by Mónica are part of everyday life in prison . Historically, trans and transvestite voices have been ignored and delegitimized. Today, the testimonies of experts are key elements that provide the Prosecutor's Office with more information to reconstruct the violence suffered by Mónica . 
> 
> The director of the CPM's Strategic Litigation Program, Augusto Infante , points out that "there are a series of difficulties that are faced in the face of the structural deprivation of rights that the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service, as a system of cruelty , exposes the general population but particularly trans women to. It is extremely important that the case be investigated from that perspective and that the context be taken into account, also considering the necessary responsibilities of the Provincial State in order to avoid the violation of Human Rights in the context of deprivation of liberty."
> 
> More than six months passed from the moment Mónica Mego began experiencing pain until the first arrangements were made for her transfer to an outpatient hospital. During that time, she spent her days between the Pettinato Jail in La Plata and Prison Unit No. 32 in Florencio Varela. On March 22, 2019, she was admitted to San Martín Hospital in the provincial capital, but her health was already very delicate. After the surgery, Mónica learned that she would never walk or use her bowel movements again . 
> 
> Confinement and torture: What happens to the health of trans women in prison?
> After the operation, Mónica spent some time in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in La Plata and was transferred back to prison. This time, to Unit 22 in Florencio Varela, where she experienced further health problems. Medical reports submitted in 2019 indicate that she was in "fair to poor general condition" and that she was not provided with physical therapy and rehabilitation treatments. Furthermore, due to the lack of assistance during her shifts, she suffered injuries and bedsores that compromised her muscles . At the time, she also reported humiliation and mistreatment due to her identity as a trans woman. 
> 
> The latest Open Data report published by the CPM revealed 50,420 cases of torture committed in Buenos Aires prisons during 2023. Lack of access to healthcare accounts for 32% of cases and is the most common type of torture in prison settings. And when it comes to trans people, the level of vulnerability becomes extreme.
> 
> Marlene Wayar recalls how this was reflected in her statement: “I thought it was pertinent to share personal experiences because I've seen that they are common experiences. I elaborated on my experience in prison. At the time Mónica Mego suffered these vicissitudes, we were already receiving certain warnings about the prison system. They were suffering from hunger and retaliation. Mónica is not the only trans person to die; there are other cases. Depriving them of medicine, of good food, depriving them of medical services… Achieving their elimination is an objective in itself and a form of training .”
> 
> Trans women pay with their lives for the contempt exuded by institutions. In 2017, Pamela Macedo Panduro and Angie Velázquez died . What did they and Mónica Mego have in common? They were trans women, transvestites, and migrants who were denied medical treatment during their detentions. According to data from the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights published in October of this year, there are 121 trans people detained in Buenos Aires prisons and jails , and the latest report from the Sub-Mesa of Imprisoned Trans Persons indicates that more than half have health problems . 
> 
> Augusto Infante warns that in prison, "a situation of special risk is created for trans women, and these situations are multiplying. This is not just the case of Mónica Mego; all trans women in prison today are exposed to a similar situation . Regardless of the serious consequences of Mónica's case, the truth is that today any trans woman in these conditions is also structurally suffering from a lack of access to the health services she needs and could eventually face consequences like those she suffered."
> 
> The CPM is working to incorporate into Mónica Mego's case the structural neglect to which the trans population housed in SPB units is exposed . However, the investigation has already been extended several times at the request of the defense, and there is no trial date yet because the Prosecutor's Office has not yet requested one (nor has it requested an extension). If this stage is reached, Mónica's case could become a benchmark in the fight against the institutional violence to which trans and transvestite people are systematically subjected in the Buenos Aires prison system. 



> Mónica Mego had become paraplegic while detained in Penitentiary Unit 32 in Florencio Varela, as a result of a lack of medical care. Due to the irreversible consequences of her neglected health condition, her case had been acquitted, but she never fully recovered and died in 2022. The prosecutor has now requested that seven members of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service, a chief, and six doctors be prosecuted for aggravated abandonment of a person, harassment, harshness, and negligent injuries. The Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM) is intervening as a private institutional victim in its capacity as the Local Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture.
> 
> ( Andar Agency ) Prosecutor Christian A. Granados, in charge of the Decentralized Investigation and Trial Prosecutor's Office No. 9 of Florencio Varela, requested that the case against seven members of the Buenos Aires Penitentiary Service be brought to trial for abandonment of a person, harshness, harassment and negligent injuries in the case of Mónica Mego. Mónica was a trans woman who was detained in Penal Unit No. 32 of Florencio Varela when she became paraplegic due to not receiving medical treatment in time. The consequences of her neglect were fatal.
> 
> In early 2019, Juan Manuel González, head of the Control Section of the care and treatment area of ​​that unit, delayed Mónica Mego's medical care despite being aware of her delicate health. Although it was clear that she needed immediate care at a health center outside Murcia due to the complexity of her condition, he delayed her transfer and referred her to another unit in the same complex. Upon her return, he housed her in a holding cell and repeatedly attacked her with humiliating treatment. He was charged with the crimes of abandonment of a person, aggravated by the injuries and severity of the injuries and humiliation.
> 
> This neglect was compounded by the negligence of the unit's medical staff, resulting in the victim suffering complete loss of mobility in her lower limbs, leaving her bedridden and unable to care for herself. As a result, the doctors who treated her at the Florencio Varela complex—Matías Pérez Núñez, Walter Raúl Piñón, Elvira Tucto, Francisco Artola, Claudio Piccin, and María Guzmán—were charged with negligent injury.
> 
> The prosecutor considers that "the doctors at the units that treated her acted imprudently, failing to exhaust all available means to obtain a diagnosis and treatment at the Unit, where the signs and symptoms characteristic of what is known as medullary syndrome began to progressively manifest." To this end, he relies, among other evidence, on the expert reports of a medical board specially appointed to analyze the case, which noted that "the professionals at this Penitentiary Unit […] [made] an underestimation of the clinical picture" and described their conduct as "careless," concluding that "by violating their duty of care, they contributed to increasing the risk to patient Mego, a circumstance that could have been avoided."
> 
> The Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM) interviewed Mónica Mego in 2019 when she was hospitalized at San Martín Hospital in La Plata, transferred from the Lisando Olmos Hospital Penitentiary Unit. Since then, she has coordinated actions with her defense team and made representations to the courts and other government agencies, and has also filed a precautionary measure with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
> 
> At the outset, the criminal investigation was significantly delayed due to a dispute over jurisdiction between the Quilmes and La Plata judicial departments. Following this delay, the investigation regained momentum with the intervention of the UFI No. 3 of La Plata, headed by Gonzalo Petit Bosnic, and the Assistant Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Occurring in Prisons of that judicial department, who summoned the prison officers to testify as defendants. At that stage, and given the realization that most of the events had occurred in the Florencio Varela prisons, the magistrate declared himself incompetent and referred the case to the Quilmes judicial department, which then fell to the Decentralized Investigative and Trial Prosecutor's Office No. 9 of Florencio Varela. Prosecutor Granados acted quickly, took a pending statement, and requested a trial for abandonment of a person, injuries, severe injuries, and harassment.
> 
> At the end of 2021, Mego's case was acquitted through the application of the doctrine and jurisprudence of natural punishment, on the grounds that the woman's suffering allowed for the waiver of any possible punishment. A few months later, in March 2022, the trans woman died at the age of 36. After her death, the CPM sided with her family from Peru and filed a complaint as a private institutional victim in order to secure the conviction of those responsible for her death. Now, almost six years after the incident, the case is close to going to trial.




> A prison chief and seven doctors were prosecuted for abandonment of a person and other crimes committed against Mónica Mego during her detention.
> May 23, 202416640
> 
> Between May 27 and June 4, the eight members of the SPB (National Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Occurring in Prison Units) of the La Plata Judicial Department—headed by prosecutor Gonzalo Petit Bosnic—are scheduled to appear before the Assistant Prosecutor's Office for Crimes Occurring in Prison Units of the La Plata Judicial Department (Prosecutor's Office), headed by prosecutor Gonzalo Petit Bosnic. This is the criminal investigation into the death of Mónica Mego, who remained in Prison Unit 32 in Florencio Varela with serious health conditions and without medical care. The Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM) is intervening as a private institutional victim; since learning of her story, the organization has filed various legal proceedings and requested a precautionary measure from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) regarding the lack of medical care suffered by the entire trans community in Buenos Aires prisons.
> 
> WALK in Justice
> 
> (Agency)  The indictment recognizes sufficient evidence to prove, at the current stage of the process, that between February 16 and March 21, 2019, at UP 32 in Florencio Varela, one of the heads of the assistance and treatment area, Juan Manuel González, illegally delayed his duty of care by abandoning Mónica Mego to her fate while she was housed in diversity pavilion 11 of module C.
> 
> Mónica's story of incarceration is a story of institutional neglect, violence, and discrimination in a prison system that particularly affects the rights of transgender people. In her case, the 36-year-old woman sought medical attention for six months due to pain that began in her back and escalated to the point where she could no longer walk without assistance.
> 
> She was first housed in the Pettinato Jail and then in Penal Unit 32 in Florencio Varela, where she received only paracetamol and ibuprofen. When she was referred to San Martín Hospital, it was too late: she underwent surgery for an epidural abscess in her spinal cord due to tuberculosis, which caused permanent paralysis of her lower limbs and the need for a urinary catheter, among other serious problems.
> 
> Juan Manuel González, one of the heads of the assistance and treatment area at UP 32, has just been prosecuted for abandonment of a person, aggravated by the injuries suffered by Mónica Mego, as well as the harshness and humiliation he inflicted on the victim when she was readmitted to the penal unit from the hospital to which she had been referred.
> 
> "A male subject, identified as Juan Manuel González, treated her harshly, harassing her without legal basis, placing her in a safe or restraining cell, despite her delicate state of health, and then, within the framework of said accommodation, repeatedly attacking her through humiliating treatment, thereby undermining her dignity and, of course, aggravating the conditions of her detention," the indictment states.
> 
> The other agents prosecuted are part of the health personnel of UP 32 and 23, both in Florencio Varela: Matías Pérez Núñez, Walter Raúl Piñón, Elvira Tucto, Francisco Artola, Claudio Piccin and María Guzmán acted recklessly in the medical care of Mónica Mego, since they did not proceed in accordance with the objective duties of care by not having exhausted the diagnostic means at their disposal.
> 
> Had this been done correctly, the indictment states, it would have been possible to make a correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment during his stay in the Unit, where the characteristic signs and symptoms of what is known as spinal cord syndrome began to progressively manifest.
> 
> "Consequently, this reckless action contributed to the victim ultimately suffering a total loss of mobility in her lower limbs, leaving her bedridden and unable to care for herself," the indictment adds.
> 
> The criminal investigation clarifies that none of the defendants was responsible for the victim's referral to an outpatient hospital. Rather, it was requested by a nurse on the unit, Vanesa Ramírez, nine days after the patient began a series of requests for medical attention, given her condition, which was already considered delicate due to her medical history.
> 
> The Provincial Commission for Memory (CPM) interviewed Mónica Mego in 2019 when she was hospitalized at San Martín Hospital in La Plata. Since then, it has coordinated actions with her defense team and made presentations to the courts and other state agencies, and filed a precautionary measure before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. At the end of 2021, Mego was acquitted through the application of the doctrine and jurisprudence of natural punishment, understanding that the woman's suffering made it possible to waive any possible punishment. A few months later, in March 2022, the trans woman died at the age of 36. After her death, the CPM sided with her family, originally from Peru, and presented itself as a private institutional victim to secure the conviction of those responsible for her death.
