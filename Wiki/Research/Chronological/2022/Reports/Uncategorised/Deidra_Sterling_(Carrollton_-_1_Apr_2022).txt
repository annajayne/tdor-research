> The body of Deidra Esmerelda Sterling was found on April 1, 2022 in Carrollton, Texas. Her case was updated January 17, 2023. Deidra was a trans woman. Her body remains unclaimed. The circumstances of her death are not suggestive of violence, she was found dead in her bed by her landlord. She was about 63.
> 
> Still, there’s something quite sad about no one claiming her body, especially in Texas.
> 
> Born and raised in Carrollton, Deidra lived in Missouri for 12 years, then Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. She returned to Carrollton in 1999. Deidra graduated from Norton Community High School. She studied accounting management at McCook Community College and in 1989 earned B.S. Degree in Business Administration at University of Nebraska at Kearney.
> 
> In her own words, Deidra describes her gender identity.
> 
> I was born a woman with a birth defect; an XY chromosome, and I lived with this appalling condition for 47 years until January 2013 when I found out that I had prostate cancer. I was cured in March 2013, but at a price, I was now totally impotent. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise because now the woman inside of me, that had been desperate to get out, had total control over my life.
> 
> I stopped resisting her in June 2013. That was when I mentally accepted my femininity. I started hormones in August 2013, then I became a woman emotionally. In November 2015 I was recognized by the state of Texas and the Federal Government as the woman I truly am when I got my name and gender marker changed. I have yet to become the total woman I long to be because I have yet to have my operations.
> 
> She also identified as a lesbian. According to her social media, she had a vast array of interests – all sorts of LGBTQ and lesbian sites, music pages, and so much more.
> 
> it is heartbreaking to think there’s no one to claim Deidra. Her death may have been due to natural causes, but she still died too young and too alone. I’ve reached out to local sources in Dallas and connected with someone who has mutual friends she is exploring now.
> 
> Rest in power, Deidra. Thank you for what you brought to the community and the joy you manifested.
