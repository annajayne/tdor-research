After failing to show up to a family gathering in New York on Monday, 30 March, 1953 or respond to phone calls, the parents of David Moskowitz contacted a neighbor on 31 March, 1953, who found the body of of David Moskowitz, aged 22-years, on a bed with their hands and feet trussed behind their back, completely dressed in female attire. There were no signs of a struggle. 

An autopsy determined the death to have most likely occured on the evening of 29 March, 1953. David was reported as having been seen driving their father's car the day of the death with an unknown second person in the car. 

Police initially determined the death to be a homicide with the cause of death being chloroform, but after 3 years of investigation a local paper reported them as now leaning towards suicide (but had no evidence to prove or disprove either murder or suicide).  The parents strongly disputed the paper's suggestion of the possibility of suicide. 

No suspect in the death was ever arrested despite the offering of rewards for information and a police investigation lasting more than 3 years.
