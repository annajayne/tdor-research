===== Trussed Body Found In Bed; Hunt Slayer =====

==== **Empty Chloroform Bottle Most Important Clue in Weird Murder of David Moskowitz, 22, Free-Lance Photographer—Women's Apparel Adds to Mystery—Autopsy Seeks Cause of Death** ====

Discovery of the trussed body of a 22-year old Sunbury young man in a bedroom of his apartment home early last evening touched off the biggest murder hunt in the history of the city.

David Moskowitz, 1045 Susquehanna Avenue, a free-lance photographer, was found bound, hand and foot, in bed by Clifford Yohn, occupant of the second-floor of the building at 6:40 p.m.

Yohn had entered the apartment after receiving a telephone call from Abraham (Al) Moskowitz, requesting him to investigate the failure of his son to join the family on a holiday in New York City.

Sgt. James Inkrote and Officer Clyde Hassinger were the first police at the scene and were joined by Chief of Police H. Clifford Gass and later by Officers Richard Wheeler and Warren Thoma of the Shamokin State Police.

Dr. George A. Deitrick, Jr., pronounced the youth dead and Dr. Sidney Kallaway, Shamokin, Northumberland County coroner investigated and said death had occurred about 24 hours before. Dr. Kallaway said: "It's one of the strangest cases I've ever seen."

home in charge of Dr. M. J. Pophal, Willamsport pathologist, assisted by Coronor Kallaway. It was still under way this afternoon.

Dr. Pophal said it would require several days for a complete report of microscopic examinations that are planned.

Dr. Kallaway said today, after another examination of the body, that the death was approximately 48 hours prior to Tuesday night and tentatively fixed the time of death as sometime Sunday night.

==== No Sign of Struggle ====

Police reported there was no sign of a struggle at any point in the house. The body, attired entirely in woman's clothing, some of which has been identified as belonging to his mother, was lying on its left side, hands tied behind the back and feet tied to gether at the ankles.

His pocketbook was on the floor and his wrist watch was on a nearby dresser. Police ruled out robbery as a motive, because there was no apparent struggle and nothing was missing. In a near-by darkroom, used by Moskowitz, was more than $1,000 in photography equipment, and a number of expensive firearms were intact in the various rooms of the house.

==== Attire Baffling ====

Perhaps the most beffling point of the case was the female clothing including earrings and necklace.

Silk stockings were rolled in garter fashion to a point just above the knee and a pair of multi-colored sandles, open toe and heel type, similar to those worn by women during the summer, were on the feet. They have been definitely identified as belong to Mrs. Moskowitz.

A black silk-like material dress covered the body from the neck to a point just below the hips and beneath the dress was a silk slip and a pair of silk panties.

The stockings were perfetly placed, the seams being straight up and down as though some one had painstakingly put them on. The earrings and necklace were made of shell material.

The body was found with the head at the foot end of the maple bed, the lower legs bent at a 30-degree angle from the knees. It was on top of the bed clothing.

Torn portions of cloth were used to tied the feet together while a pair of silk stockins helf the arms in place behind his back.

A piece of white cloth was wrapped about the head, one section passing over the bridge of the nose and the second over the upper lip. Police said the bandage-like wrappings would not have interfered with breathing.

The family was unable to give an explanation to investigating officers in regard to the attire of their son, and said they never knew of any tendencies that would cause him to wear such clothing. They said he had expressed violent opposition to change in sex operations, such as in the Christine Jorgenson case which gained national prominence several moths ago.

Police questioned neighbors and frieds of the young man but where unable to learn any additional facts that would shed light on the situation.

==== Family In New York ====

Mr. and Mrs. Moskowitz, along with two other sons, Leonard, a student at Pennsylvania State College, and  Morris, who is the the third grade of the Fifth Ward school, were in New York from Sunday until last night. The parents were visiting their former homes during the Feast of the Passover.

Their son was to join them in New York late Monday after taking a physical examination at the Westinghouse Television-Radio Diviion plant, where he was scheduled to assume a job soon as a photographer. When he did not arrive, the called home Tuesday and late in the afternoon when unable to arouse anyone, called the Yohn residence of the second floor of the duplex building.

Mr. Yohn told police he entered the first floor via the cellarway, believing all the doors to be locked. However, later it was learned a door facing Julia street was unlocked, a key to the door having been found in a drawer in the living room.

Mr. and Mrs. Moskowitz arrived home at 11:35 p.m. after leaving New York at about 7:30 p.m. Mrs. Mosowitz was in a state of shock and had to receive treatment from Dr. Daniel Solomon.

Their son has been employed in the office of the Weis Pure Food Stores, Inc., in the advertising department. He was a well known aarea potographer and did free-lance work for area newspapers. He was scheduled to take hs new position at Westinghouse thise week, provided he could pass the physical exam. He never arrived for the examination, Westinghouse officials told his parents.

==== Police Without Clues ====

Investigating police indicated they were without substantial clues with which to work, although the obtained a number of articles of clothing which beloned to Moskowitz and are planning to send them to the State Police laboratories for tests.

A half-pint bottle, believed to have contained chloroform, was found on top of a pile of his male clothing near the bed, the clothing having been placed on an overstuffed chair in a manner that indicated it was put there while being changed. POlice hope to obtain some fingerprints from the bottle and today George F. Witmer, Shamokin, special investigator for the county, attempted to obtain finger prints at the residence.

Without a motive and with little information, police were handicapped but expect reports from the laboratory test to privde them with a lead. They are also tracing the movements of the young man over the weekend and into last week and have compiled a list of names of friends whom they plan to contact.

Dr. Kallaway said it was definitely a homicide case, and he placed the time of death as sometime prior to 6 a.m. Tuessday.

==== Last Seen Sunday ====

Moskowitz was last seen alive Sunday, the first time being near 2 p.m. when his parents left for New York driving his car. His father had difficulty starting the car, recently purchaes by the young man, and David shouted instructions from the house. A neighbor told police she saw him driving his father's car between 5 and 6 p.m. Sunday. He was accompanied by another person.

The parents told police their son had intended to come to New York Monday and Mrs. Moskowitz said she remembered her son saying "I'll see you Monday, mother."

Mr. and Mrs. Yohn told police they saw nothing suspicious about the property during the weekend and were not aware that Moskowitz was missing until they received a call from the family in New York in regard to his failure to come there.

==== House Not Disturbed ====

Interior of the MOskowitz house gave no indication that there had been any disturbance. On the kitchen gas stove was a half-filled pot of coffee and a sauce pan in which tea had been made. Two tea bags were in the pan.

The refrigerator was well stocked with food and Mr. Moskowitz said the three quarts of milk in it were placed there Sunday. They were not disturbed.
Two books entitled "Fantastic Adventures" and "WIth Death in His Corner" were found, one in th eliving room and the second in the lavatory. The radio was playing faintly, police said.

==== Photog Ban Puzzling ====

A state police ban on newspaper photographs at the scene of the crime was explained today by District Attorney Harold F. Bonno following investigation. He was informed that the officers and not been notified until some time after the body was found and arrived two hours after the discovery. In the meantime the Moskowitz house had been invaded by a number of curious people, and the first thought of the investigating offficers was to prevent any further disturbance of the scene. How the taking of photographs would have interfered with the investigation was not explained by the officers. Mr. Bonnon, who was not involved in the incident, made a prompt investigation of the matter when informed what had taken place.

David Moskowitz was born in New York, October 1, 1930, a son of Abraham and Rose Galubsky Mosowitz. The family has resided in Sunbury since November 29, 1944, when Mr. Moskowitz wook up work as a guard at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg.
