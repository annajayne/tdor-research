near, we the parents of the deceased David Moskowitz again appeal to all of you for help in solving the mystery of the murder of David on March 29, 1953," the appeal said.

"It seems impossible that with so many people living in the immediate neighborhood, that no one saw the murderer or murderers enter or leave our home after we bid our son good-bye at 12:15 p.m. on that date. How can anyone enjoy the holidays knowing they are covering up one or more murderers?

"How can anyone who did see these murderers go along with such knowledge on their mind, not knowing if these same murderers are planning to do the samme thing to someone else because they seem to think they got away with murder once before?

"The murderers will eventually be apprehended but every day longer they are permitted to roam the streets is another day that they may use to murder someone else whom they may have a fancied grievance against.

"If you have any knowledge or have heard anything that may help in solving the crime that much faster, either contact us by mail at 1045 Susquehanna avenue, or call us at 2335 or notify the local police or State Police. If you choose to remain anonymous, it will be not be necessary for you the mention or sighn your name to anything. Your information will be held in the strictest confidence.

"The reward offer of $2,000 still stands for any information aiding in the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the death of David Moskowitz on March 29, 1953."

Meanwhile, police are continuing the probe, hopeful of discovering something that will crack the case. Investigation has been under the direction of Detective Sergeant George Funk, Pennsylvania State police, since April 1, 1953. He makes weekly trips to Sunbury, except when his work keeps him in Harrisburg or some other part of the state.

Police records list the death of the young free-lance photographer as homicide.

Most baffling part of the case, according to police, is that no motive for either homicide or suicde can be found. And police indicated that until a motive is found, their probe is virtually at a standstill, although the continue to check statements and facts uncovered in the first several months of the investigation.

Frequently, Sg.t Funk and Officer William J. Hassinger, of the Sunbury Police, confer with Assistant District Attorney Michael Kivko, in regard to the case.

Mr. Kivko said today: "There has been no disposition of the case and there are no new developments." He in turn keeps District Attorney Harold F. BOnno informed of the progress and together the confer periodically.

"This matter is not a dead issue and every day the police are looking for new approaches to the case. They are leaving no stone unteruned in their probe," Mr. Kivko said.

"However, there are many unexplained deaths, where no motive is apparent, simliar to this case," the assistant district attorney said.

Police studied closely a Maine Medical Society journal in which more than a score of mysterious deaths were outlined, complete with pictures and details.

In many instances, the Sunbury case was similar to those in that victims were found with feet and hands tied behind them, either dead by hanging or poison.

Young Moskowitz was bound at the hands and feet, was wearing women's apparel, and death was caused by chloroform, traces of which were found in the lining of the stomach.

In the Maine Medical Society report o such deaths, many of the victims were psychopaths, and medical science has been unable to determine what caused them to act as they did. Many times there was nothing in the victim's background to indicated an abnormal condition, and there was no cause for such an act, the journal said.

According to the Maine journal, acts of perversion are not involved in these cases and police feel sure the same holds true in the Moskowitz case. This point was covered closely in the early stages of the Sunbury investigation.

Investigation into the local case has been in progress for nearly 21 months and substantial rewards have been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.

Mr. Moskowitz offered a reward of $2,000 and The Daily Item offered $500. These rewards are still in effect today.

At one time police said they were hopeful the rewards would lead to a promising clue, but none has developed.
