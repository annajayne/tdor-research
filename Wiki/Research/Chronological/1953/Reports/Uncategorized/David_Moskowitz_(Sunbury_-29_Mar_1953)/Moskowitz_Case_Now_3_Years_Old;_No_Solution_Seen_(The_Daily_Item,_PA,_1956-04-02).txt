===== Moskowitz Case Now 3 Years Old; No Solution Seen =====

It is three years ago today that the trussed body of David Moskowitz, 22-year-old city free lance photographer, was found on a bed at his home at 1045 Susquehanna avenue.

The you was garbed in women's clothing from skin out and his hands and legs were bound. On a pile of clothing on a chair lay an empty bottle that had contained chloroform.

The wierd circumstances under which the body was found touched off one the most extensive investigations in the history of Northumberland County. The probe continues with no official solution in sight.

Rewards totalling $3,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons who may have been responsible for the youn man's death still stand.

Doubts that the rewards will ever be collected continue to grow as more and more people, officially and unofficially connected with the case, adhere to the theory of suicide. Such beliefs are based mainly on records of other deaths of a similar nature and the lack of a motive for murder.

A few months after the death, District Attorney Harold F. Bonno issue a statement that a chemical analysis of the youth's organs resulted in a definte finding of the presence of chloroform in the lining of the stomach. "This finding, together with the available professional opinion to the effect that the chloroform was introduces through the mouth only, has led to a new avenue of investigation." At the time Bonno was pressed for an explanation but he refused to clarify the statement. It was taken as a definite hint at suicide.

There were enough extenuating circumstances, however, that kept the record open.

Although Bonnon was not available for comment to day on whether he intends to continue the case or close it, there are indiciation he has no immediate plans to close it, meaning the record will remain open.

Sgt. George Funk, detective for the Pennsylvania State Police who was assigned to the case the day after the body was discovered, was in Sunbury about a week and a hal ago, checking with the district attorney and the Sunbury police department on the possiblity of any new developments in the case.

Officer William Hassinger, who has been on the case since it broke, said he and the local department are also waiting for an official opinion from the district attorney. He said it has been six months or more since the last suspect was questioned. Authorities have been corresponding with the Moskowitz family in Connecticut.

Hassinger said they have examined thousands of photographs and negatives that belonged to the young photographer and have found nothing in the way of a clue.

Moskowitz not only was dressed in female attire but he wore earrings and a necklace. His feet were tied with lengths of clothing and his hands were bound behind him by silk stocking. The body was found lying on its left side on the bed and the bedclothes showed no signs of being mussed. The only depression on the bed was where his body lay.

A neighbor, Clifford Yohn, occupant of a second-floor apartment in the building, discovered the body. Mr. and Mrs. Abraham Moskowitz were in New York for a religious holiday and the son was to join them. When he did not arrive they called Yohn and asked him to investigate. It was then that he found the body.

There were no signs of a struggle in the room. POlice found several magazines in the house. One of them contained an illustration of a story character trussed in a manner similar to Moskowitz's body.

Dozens of rumors beganin making the rounds. Attemps were made to link the youth with a "dream club."

Every lead was tracked down and none of the rumors were verified.

The probe extended into 30 counties and included interviewing some 600 persons. Lie detector tests were given some suspects.

The manner in which Moskowitz's body was trussed was puzzling to investigators, at least at the start, the theory being he couldn't have bound himself. Soon after a number of person, who took a curious interest in the case, including a professional legal man and an amateur criminologist, helped debunk the theory by actually performing the act and proving that "it could be done."

The attention of local police was drawn recently to an article in a medical journal by a Harvard University psychology professor. The article included pictures of a variety of suicide methods, including one figure which illustrated the nature and postition and circumstance under which the Moskwitz body was found.

Chief of Police H. Clifford Gass today expressed extreme doubt that the case will ever be closed. He said: "We have our own conclusions but no facts to substantiate them."
