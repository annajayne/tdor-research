==== **An Open Letter to the Editor and the Public:** ====

I am writing you this letter in answer to an article you had in your issues of March 31 and April 2, 1958.

For some unexplained reason, your reporter who has been writing the articles on my son David's MURDER has been stressing the possibility that it may have been suicide, mainly on the unsupported statements of so called and unnamed experts. Why arent these experts named In these articles? Wll these experts demonstrate their so called theories before me and a group of law enforcement officers? I would also like to have at least two qualified M. Ds. watch the demonstration. Will these so called experts . voluntarily take and hold enough chloroform to make a lethal dose, in their mouth while they tie themselves in the same manner my son was found tied in? Will they get into clothing at least 8 sizes too small for them without tearing such clothing? "Will they" lie down after taking such lethal dose and remain absolutely still? Does this look like suicide?

Do you realize that you are giving moral encouragement to the murderers by publishing such articles? Do you realize that you have possibly scared anyone who may have some information by giving same by publishing the name of anyone who might have information? Would the police keep the case open for three long years if they could take the easy way out by calling it suicide? Do you realize that you are hampering the investigation by making such wild guesses? We, as parents of the deceased David Moskowitz know that our son had absolutely no reason for even contemplating suicide. 

Will you have the courage to publish this letter in your paper?
Yours, 
Mr. and Mrs. A. Moskowitz
