> 'There was never a woman like Gilda', read the tagline of the 1946 film named after Rita Hayworth's character. The classic American noir turned the actress into such a sex symbol that she even said: “They sleep with Gilda and wake up with me.” It is not possible to say that Rubens Aparecido Rinque, born four years after the premiere of the film in Ipiporã, Paraná, was inspired by the character of Rita, but he created his own version of Gilda on the streets of Curitiba.
> 
> In the 1970s, the transvestite circulated in the city center, specifically in the Boca Maldita area, where she became a folkloric figure asking for alms in a unique way: “And today, what will it be? A coin or a kiss?” For those who refused to contribute financially to the purchase of a cachaça, she would pour a drink, whether the person liked it or not.

> As popular as she was miserable, Gilda Tupiniquim died in 1983, at the age of 32, possibly from purulent meningitis, with liver cirrhosis and bronchopneumonia as antecedents, according to newspapers at the time. Even though the hypothesis of violence has been officially ruled out, her death now inspires a comic detective novel called “A coin or a kiss”.

In that edition of the event, the then mayor Marcelo Crivella ordered the collection of a Marvel comic, on the grounds that it should be sealed and covered, just because, in its pages, there was a gay kiss. The screenwriter says, in the afterword, that he sought to react to this type of censorship by creating a story with an LGBTQIA + theme.

> Gilda de Abreu (as she called herself), or Rubens Aparecido Rinque, was born on September 7, 1950, in Ibiporã, northern region of Paraná. He arrived in Curitiba in 1973, approximately 22/23 years old, probably enchanted by the frequent advertisements made about the “model city” that he was developing. His presence in Curitiba was also attributed, according to rumors, to the fact that he came to the city together with a troupe of circus artists, after a heartbreak, a case that was never confirmed (like so many others about his life) (BONI , 2009, p. 105). She stayed in the city for a short time – approximately 10 years –, but while she remained, Gilda created history, revolt, friends, enemies and gained fame not only as “the first gayCuritiba”, but also as one who disturbed, transgressed, expanded and spread kisses and laughter in the city center. The choice to talk about this character is justified in order to highlight her, since, for a long time, attempts were made to erase her story from the city's memory. It was also decided to call her dela by her artistic name, since the transvestite was known only by that name in life. In 1984, three years after the violent act against transvestites during carnival, in which Anfrísio Siqueira, then president of Boca Maldita, kicked Gilda in the mouth, preventing her from getting on one of the floats, the carnival block “Embaixadores da Alegria” created the samba-plot “Gilda sem nome” in her honor, making reference to her anonymity in the song's title. She never said her name, she just called herself “Gilda de Abreu” (SIERRA, 2013, p.91). In the first verse, the samba remembers the games that Gilda was asked to play with a certain someone, in exchange for cigarettes, cachaça, coffee or coins: “Oh, how I miss you, that you came to me! Of the jokes that Gilda played. Fifty bucks to kiss someone.” After all, she didn't just steal kisses by her own choice, many were suggestions from those who already knew her, in order to get up to mischief with friends. And she didn't choose a person, because Gilda “kissed the doctor… the senator”. Perhaps for this reason she was the victim of attacks and exclusion from the square, especially by President Anfrísio Siqueira, who claimed that she was invading a “well frequented” place: Repudiated by part of Curitiba society, the memory of Gilda (1950-1983 ) remained and even gave rise to the appearance of several artistic manifestations. As part of this repertoire, we selected four works: the samba-enredo “Gilda sem nome” (1984), “Beijo na boca maldita” (short film, 2008), “Cabaré Concerto Gilda” and “Gilda invited Maria Bueno” ( presentations artistic activities with shows, theater, video and performance, 2010 and 2015, respectively). We seek to understand Gilda's urban interferences dela as influences for these works mentioned-as the character performed in the streets, dressed in paraphernalia, clothes and makeup and acted out with her well-known speech dela “a coin or a kiss” [ 1 ]. Gilda's artistic intention cannot be confirmed, as her interference on the street could often be a joke or a form of survival. Using these works as illustrations, we intend to reflect on Gilda's expansiveness and bodily spontaneity, understanding them as instigators of artistic productions. The reverberations that Gilda left are understood as a relevant way of questioning bodily and sexual imprisonment in urban centers, especially in a city known for its conservatism like Curitiba. And instead of disciplined and forgotten bodies in the crowds of urban centers, cross-dressed, prostituted, subversive bodies are presented, which contrast and provoke revolt and astonishment. The importance of occupying these public spaces is evident here, many considered dangerous and/or abandoned, such as Boca Maldita, next to Praça Osório, in Curitiba. Located in the city center, the place offers a variety of commerce, transforming throughout the 1970s into a closed space occupied essentially by a male fraternity to discuss all types of subjects, bringing together politicians, artists, professionals, retirees and sportsmen. . Even today, there is a considerable number of men, who meet for coffee, conversations, readings and more. It is in the midst of this scenario that Gilda – considered the first transvestite in Curitiba – wandered around as a beggar, with a beard, skirt and red lipstick. Some spaces in the city currently also include scenes and characters like Gilda, but here the attention will be focused on Praça Osório and Boca Maldita, a scenario that at the time contrasted the most elite portion of the public with marginalized figures, who still awaken today scared and curious looks from passersby in the region. In the samba-enredo Gilda sem nome , we allude to the illusionism provoked by Gilda, in the metamorphosis created between the types she celebrated with her strange attire. It is inevitable to associate it with the carnival principle already discussed by Mikhail Bakhtin when he addresses the inversion that occurred during the Shrovetide celebrations.

> Curitiba was marked by Gilda's red lipstick, in the gray and cold streets, in the squares and, especially, at carnivals. The character was known for her appearances during carnival parades: “Gilda, your carnival marked / For a long time the city's routine”. And the avenue was really her natural stage, since, unlike those men who waited for Carnival to cross-dress and have fun, Gilda was “flapper, oriental princess” all year round. She was the personification of carnival. Another record that also reports on her relationship with carnival and other interference in the city is the documentary by Yanko Del Pino, from 2008, in which the director presents some testimonies from bar owners, journalists, artists, carnival attendees and her own lawyer, who remember the extravagant, fun figure who did not show discouragement, even when he was sick, hungry and dirty. One of the facts reported in the documentary is an attempt to pay tribute after her death in 1983. The cause of death itself, in the documentary, is considered uncertain, as some claim that the transvestite was the victim of violence from a lover; others claim it was suicide; Some say he suffered an overdose and some say it was a street fight. What is stated on her death certificate is that Gilda suffered from bronchopneumonia, liver cirrhosis and purulent meningitis, having been found dead in an abandoned house on Rua Desembargador Motta, in the city center. The fact is that Gilda's transgressive and embarrassing body remained even after her death. The day after her death, Boca Maldita dawned full of flowers and notes and, according to Dante José Mendonça's statement, “she did deserve a statue. Because, after she died, whether she liked it or not, she became an icon” [2] . There was an attempt, not at a statue, but at a bronze plaque in Boca Maldita, with the words: “Gilda, you are missed. People of Curitiba”. And, once again, Gilda was boycotted: the sign was removed by the president of Boca. But neither the boycotts by the president of Boca, nor the protests of revolt by other visitors to the space were enough to stop the tributes and invalidate the work and records about the character Gilda. One of the most recent of these is the artistic manifestation that involved shows, performances and artistic workshops, in February 2015, called “Gilda invites Maria Bueno”. The play, performed by CiaSenhas,a theater company from Curitiba, is a second version of the work that pays homage to the transvestite – the first of which, “Cabaré Concerto Gilda”, took place in the same location, in 2010. The event featured artists from different areas (music , theater, performance, visual arts, video) and took place on one of the busiest nightlife streets in the city: Rua São Francisco. The format of the demonstration itself recalls what it meant to be Gilda: a manifesto, a free act in the streets, a hybrid of man-woman, glamour-decadence, laughter-misery, life-putrefaction, crowd-solitude, sincerity-irony . The entire program took place along the street, with free entry, and proposed discussions about what characters like Gilda represented (and represent) in the urban context of a “cold, gray and sullen” city in the eyes of those who live and/or transit through this space, and they are doomed to live in bodies that no longer overflow and transgress like Gilda. This dissemination of versions about transvestites attests to the acceptance it had in social circles, from politicians, students, artists to homeless people.

> The body in the city
> To understand the presence of figures like Gilda in the city and the disturbing, profane and contrasting bodies of the growing city, it is necessary to present notes on the concept of Modernity and its relationship with the body, individual and gender. In The Manifesto of the Communist Party (1999) , written in 1848, Marx and Engels already pointed out elements that would mark the stage of Modernity, such as: the breaking of limits between morality and nature, age and sex, day and night caused by mechanization and industrialization; the global invasion of modern bourgeois society; the rapid improvement of production instruments; the constant progress of the media; the creation of large urban centers; the clustering of populations; the loss of manual labor; the growth of capital and wage labor. In other words, all previously solid and linear constructions now in Modernity are “dissolved, all newly formed relationships age before they can ossify. Everything that is solid melts into air” (MARX and ENGELS, 1999, p.70). Marshall Berman (2007), alluding to Marx's thought from the title of the work, addresses the phases of the phenomenon known as Modernity: the incipient modern phase of the 21st century. XVI to XVIII; the second, marked by the revolutionary wave of 1790; the third, dominant in the century. XX, a time in which man, according to the critic himself, lost his modern roots. Choosing the intermediate phase as the basis of his study, Berman perceives there, despite the most critical views, a bet on the future that would have ended in the 20th century, to conclude: “The basic argument of this book is, in fact, that modernisms from the past can develop in us a sense of our own modern roots, roots that go back two hundred years” (BERMAN, 2007, p. 47 and 48). Following a reading close to this, Antoine Compagnon also theorizes about Modernity, in this case focusing on its artistic facet, and verifies the presence of five steps since the last decades of the 19th century: Manet's painting, Lunch on the Grass ; cubism, Duchamp's ready-mades and Proust's work In Search of Lost Time; the Manifesto of Surrealism (1924); the fourth moment is located between the cold war and 1968, while the fifth and last has its peak in the 80s. As with Berman, an opposition is not exactly defended, demarcating Modernity from Post-Modernity, but rather a distinction that is made through developments in relation to the previous movement. If for Berman, postmodernism is characterized as one of the exits from modernism in the 60s, understood here in an uncritical and inconsistent way, for Compagnon it would be nonsense to consider postmodernism as contrary to the modern spirit, since in The basis of the modernist principle is the notion of the new, that is, the attempt to break with tradition. How could there be something new that sets itself against the new? In summary: […] postmodern is above all a controversial slogan, deceitfully positioning itself against the ideology of modernity or against modernity as an ideology, that is, denying less Baudelaire's modernity, in its ambiguity and its torn apart, than that of the historical vanguards of the 20th century. (COMPAGNON, 1996, p.104). Based on these assumptions, we allow ourselves, in our analysis, to rescue from the modern Baudelairean gaze the glimpses of impulses very close to the “post-modern era” and which mix indifference, contempt, pity or even solidarity of passersby; considerations very close to the body and the city. Berman (2007) brings Marx to understand how power relations in dominant capitalist and industrialist systems were sacrificing a huge group of people in the name of technical advances. Marx's vision shows us human relationships diluted in the heavy work of factories, in the time-space relationship reduced and controlled by long working hours. Let us recall here the image of that body proposed in Fritz Lang's feature film, Metropolis [3] : cold, robotic, mechanized and equalized. Marx ( apud BERMAN, 2007, p. 29) shows that modern advances, while facilitating work, enslaves human beings. Still on the contrasts and inequalities that 'progress' brought to cities, Baudelaire offers in his picture painted with words “The Eye of the Poor”, the disparity between the subjects inside a luxurious Parisian café in relation to those on the street (or they live in it) and, hungry, they have no access to the bright and magical place. It is these contrasts that we also point out, when comparing the bodies that walk down the street, with those that live on the street,street. Before, some other elements of Post-Modernity (or even late Modernity) will be pointed out, such as: space-place and time relationships, the body in crowds, the idea of ​​​​subject and identity, eroticism and sexuality, for then we can understand who Gilda was and how she related to these issues. Contradiction, paradox, and even irony are inherent factors of Modernity. Marx points to the inconsistency of relationships, the difficulty of providing answers, and a place where the sacred is profaned. Regarding the sacred, Nietzsche ( apud BERMAN, 2007, p. 31) will also say that religious ideals, the integrity of the soul and truths are called into question, bringing a feeling of absence and emptiness of values ​​to humanity, but at the same time, “amid a disconcerting abundance of possibilities” ( id., p.32). It is important here to emphasize that the individual, in the midst of so many transformations, “dares to individualize himself” ( id., ibid.). For Orlandi (2012), this individualization appears in the subject's relationship with his body, as the latter reveals in its materiality its processes of meaning, the imaginary and the symbolic. The subject's body shows his speech through his movements, his actions among people and his image (clothing, hair, etc.). Gilda, even in the midst of crowds, created an identity, a unique positioning, a singular image in the midst of the city that is beginning to emerge in the city. In addition to daring to create her identity, Gilda desecrated all ideals, not only religious but also political, by “invading” a space socially demarcated by a straight, male, middle-class group. It is already possible to point out a new perception of the body, which is no longer related only to the sacred, a place of sin in which the very act of touching it to wash it would be considered a scandal. We see the emergence of bodily autonomy and concern, whether in hygiene, sexuality, freedom or increasing studies on the subject. Benjamin (2000) also presents us with the concept of the individual in opposition to the collective as typically modern bourgeois ideals. This bourgeois redefinition of private space made the individual turn towards himself and his family. It also points us to the phenomena of industrialization, urbanization and crowds, with the latter item affecting the subject, who, by individualizing himself, tries to assert his identity. On the other hand, it is in the crowd that the subject becomes equal to the others: he is just one more. In this sense, Gilda was not equal in the crowd, she was unique. Although lonely in his experience, in his poverty, in his true identity, he shared experiences in this growing city that stood out among the discreet population of Curitiba. It is in this network of changes that more rational, individual thoughts linked to science gaining strength, culminating in the French Revolution in 1789. And now, what was Gilda if not the materialization of this transgression of the display of the body and the dilution of barriers between feminine and masculine, since she showed off on the streets and at carnivals in low-cut, flowery clothes, worn on a visibly masculine body? What was it if not the opposite of this robotic being, formed along industrial lines and conditioned to repetitions of bodily movements only? However, in a fabric like that of the metropolis, which tends towards the invisibility of the subject, it is not strange for figures and trends to appear that try to break away from these robotic bodies. And it is also important to highlight that the modernization process, as Canclini (2013) presents us, has not yet finished, that is, there is no rupture, a line that separates Modernity from Post-Modernity. And it is in urban plurality that we understand which subjects are part of it, how they relate to each other, just as we understand how the city grows, moves, changes through looking at these bodies. According to Hissa and Nogueira “the body experiences the city. The city lives through the bodies of its subjects. The city is a body-city” (2013, p. 56). Not only are the spaces and time of cities reconfigured, but also the space-time of the body. This post-modern body space is reduced if we think that crowds squeeze passers-by in large urban centers, in the daily hustle and bustle. For Diogenes (apud HISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013), the contemporary Western body is invaded by “armors”, and then becomes hard, rigid, a body that no longer “dances” anymore, perhaps because among the crowd there is no there is more room for it to move. The opposite of this body is the character Gilda, who is not invaded: she is the one who invades. She walks, walks, sings and dances (literally) through the busy gray streets of Curitiba in the mid-70s and 80s, and lets herself be expansive in the surroundings of Praça Osório, to the crooked gazes of gentlemen in suits. In addition to space being redefined, time, which had already been transformed and accelerated in Modernity, will see this process intensified in Post-Modernity. With the arrival of information technology and, even more so, with digital technology, the idea of ​​speed is accelerated, as movement between places takes place more quickly, instantly, and not in person (SANTAELLA, 2004, p. 28). However, it seems to us that this rapid transit is not the same as that of bodies that live on the street. As Milton Santos states: “the poor, who do not experience the city of haste , are left with invention. Slow men are unaware – or disregard – of the rules inscribed in urban daily life and, precisely for this reason, for them, their memory is useless” ( apudHISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013, p. 59). Again we mention Gilda who, in addition to making the street her home, walked around and asked for kisses, patiently, without the rush of passers-by late for work. However, as previously seen in Canclini (2013), modernization arrives in different ways in different places, as illustrated in “Eyes of the Poor”, a prose poem by Baudelaire (1995). On the one hand, it is the spectacle of glass, sparkles and lights illuminating the city; on the other, it is the darkness that awaits him outside the gloomy street. For the author, colonized countries are always being colonized and access to goods is unequal between citizens, politicians, workers and businesspeople, artisans and artists. (CANCLINI, 2013, p.18). Harvey (1992) also points to the different conceptions of space for each group, such as “territories” for American Indians and US colonizers. And, in both cases, both Harvey and Canclini agree that time-space relations happen in different ways, mainly due to the power relations involved and the subject's positions, as colonized or colonizers, as bourgeoisie or proletariat, among others. “In the city, we always mix – even when there is no desire to mix...” (HISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013, p. 58). The stability of cities deteriorated considerably after the 19th century, and people found themselves lost among the masses, in the streets, in factories, on battlefields. Baudelaire (1995) uses the metaphor “bathing in crowds” at the beginning of the poem “The Crowds”, which expresses precisely this diving, mixing among strangers and becoming unknown in this environment, too. Let us now think about Gilda who, even when mixed in the crowd, she stood out and managed to be authentic. Unlike Baudelaire's flâneur , who only observes the crowd and the city, Gilda was the crowd, she wasthe city, but even so, she was also herself, unique, irreverent, daring. She wasn't just the Baudelairean passive observer, who didn't interact. “Seeing the city is living the city, experiencing it on its terrain, territory, world.” (HISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013, p.56). Gilda lived the city, she experienced it, she was a present, alive body. And she was uncomfortable. In the aforementioned “The Eyes of the Poor”, Baudelaire brings the suffering reality of this city that grows and, directly proportionally, increases its number of homeless people, its violence and its unemployment. For Menezes (2003, p.227), “the social changes brought about by the new mode of production caused cities to swell and those who did not find jobs in the market were doomed to live in the streets and squares”. Gilda was one of them. Baudelaire sees in these characters – prostitutes, criminals, gamblers and beggars – the modern hero, as he felt close to them. And just like prostitutes, for example, also in their time “prostituted” their work, after all, everything was for sale. Including art, which loses its sacred and irreproducible characteristic (BENJAMIN, 2013). Another poem by Baudelaire that we can relate to episodes in Gilda's life is “Spank the Poor”. This recalls the case when Gilda, when trying to climb on one of the floats of the Curitiba carnival in March 1981 (a celebration in which she participated by parading in front of the Banda Polaca float), was kicked in the mouth by the then president of the Boca Maldita, Anfrísio Siqueira, and was arrested on the grounds that she was disruptive and that her figure was not compatible with the organization of the event, nor with the location. Outraged by the event, a group of people organized a protest and Gilda was released after a few days. The transvestite, obviously, contrasted, even during carnival, with the serious faces of Curitiba at the time and with the grayness of the city.

> It would be difficult to accept it, even in the middle of a party in which the roles of men and women are reversed in the game of carnival costumes. This exclusion was probably reinforced by the sanitary discourses inherited from the end of the 19th century and which were strongly disseminated at the beginning of the 20th century in Brazil, especially in large capitals, which aimed to exclude from public life those who represented any danger to society. , such as the spread of infectious diseases, for example. Beatriz Sarlo (2005) states that transvestism scandalizes and provokes curiosity, but is only accepted (if we can use that word) in certain situations, such as a humorous program, in which this figure is ridiculed and satirized. Sarlo uses the example of Argentine comedy programs, such as Gasalla , in which men appear dressed as women and the reception of these images on television is well accepted, unlike what happens in the Argentine neighborhood of Palermo: To my knowledge, no one has established a relationship between this range of successful comic transvestites and the high urban visibility of transvestites. It is very likely that the citizens who protest against the use of public space by transvestites are the spectators themselves who enjoy Gasalla. (SARLO, 2005, p.76) For people like Gilda, this street space is still territory to be conquered, even though it is her home and belongs to her just like other passers-by. Mass crowds positively receive the image of transvestites, prostitutes, transsexuals, homeless people and drunks, while they only reach them through the media. Now, if they are on the street, no. They are beaten, excluded and ignored in their existence, since life on the street is not as fun as life on the television screen. Talking about passers-by on modern and post-modern streets is also putting into discussion the idea of ​​the subjectas suggested by René Descartes (1983). This idea of ​​human subjectivity, in which mind and body are analyzed separately, and the latter is seen as less relevant than the intellect, is refuted, especially after the theories of Marx, Freud, Nietzsche and Heidegger. It is with these authors, too, that it is understood that human subjectivities, as well as the body, are created in discourse, constructed in history, language, culture and power relations (SANTAELLA, 2004). These questions interest us here in order to understand that beyond space-time, architecture, arts, literature and the subject cannot be taken as universal, heterogeneous and indivisible. There are different subjects who are constructed in the city, with different subjectivities and who have a bodily history that relates to this urban space. Therefore, as Descartes did, it is not possible to separate it from the mind and understand it as less relevant. The limits that seek to define and separate differences such as man and woman, natural and artificial, real and virtual are also called into question. Gilda, in some statements from the short film “Gilda: the kiss from the cursed mouth”, is portrayed as someone who moved between the two sexes: she was not just a man, not just a woman, not just a transvestite, not just gay . It was diverse, plural, multifaceted, not even its origin being known. For Butler (2004), gender is precisely characterized by its changing essence, a constant creation that may or may not subvert the predominant dualistic patterns, since the human being is re-articulable, not crystallized and is formed by convergence between the biological and the cultural. Beatriz Preçado, in an interview with Carrillo (2010), also agrees with Butler when stating that queer theory shifts discussions of gender from the unique notions of sexual and gender differences to a discussion of a transversal nature, that is, a more open analysis and flexible than that proposed by feminist groups in the 1960s, in which there is an “overflow of homosexual identity itself across its margins: fagots, sissies, gays, transgenders, whores, disabled gays and lesbians, black and Chicanalesbians, and an endless etc.” (p.5). There is an exchange relationship between city and body. Through the history of the city we can identify which bodies exist, as well as the opposite: we say that the city exists through looking at the bodies. We have already seen that Baudelaire observed this growing, bustling city, and that he maintained a certain appreciation for those excluded from the streets of Paris, such as prostitutes, for example. Although Gilda doesn't fully fit into this category, as she only asked for “five cruises or a kiss”, and if she was denied the money, she would kiss whoever was there. Or even, she kissed when they offered coins so she could play a joke on someone. This body, unlike those that circulate in a hurry, stiff and doomed to fatigue from the rush, appeared to be a free body, even though it had disapproving eyes turned towards itself. Gilda lived in Curitiba between the 1970s and 1980s, and even considering the feminist and hippie movements of the 60s, discussions of Psychoanalysis and Foucault's philosophy, which disseminated and expanded reflection on the body, were still (and are ) anyone who deviates from heteronormativity is highly frowned upon. And, more than gays and prostitutes, transvestites, according to Sarlo (2005): They exhibit a type of sex that disturbs more than any other. What is disturbing is the collapse of the single norm, the weakening of what was considered 'normality'. What is disturbing is the visible transgression of what we consider, without much thought, as 'natural'. (p.74).

> The body that lives on the street – unlike the one that only crosses it at certain periods, or even the other that is protected by car windows – lives in different times, occupies that space differently and exposes itself in another way. . Your body is the only asset that belongs to you, in most cases, as Pelbart quotes “[...] the only thing left for the poor is their body” ( apud HISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013, p.59). Walking without destination, without rushing, without direction is also opposed to walking in a car, the first being the one who actually sees the city, not just quickly looking at the shop windows and passers-by.

> Pelbart also tells us that this body of “slow men” is a body of resistance, as “resistance emerges through survival” ( cited inHISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013, p.59). Whether it's surviving low temperatures (in the case of Curitiba, where they are more frequent than high temperatures), whether it's getting food, taking care of your belongings so they don't get robbed, or the violence between street residents. Gilda experienced these situations, having been a victim of violence among her own “comrades” on the street, being hung and stabbed at least once. And it is nothing new for prostitutes, transvestites and transsexuals to suffer violence, especially in city nightlife. The body as a commodity, especially one that clashes with all heteronormativity and physical standards considered “natural” or “normal” has always had a place for curiosity and fetishism, but even so, it has not prevented violence and exclusion from happening. Understanding heteronormative here as situations in which individuals are standardized within the condition that opposite sexes (cisgender men and women) only relate, or even, the term (coined in 1991 by Michael Warner), can be “understood and problematized as a standard of sexuality that regulates the way Western societies are organized.” (PETRY; MEYER, 2011, p.196). In the case of transvestism, these curious and/or scared looks are heightened, since these bodies are hypersexualized. Huge silicone implants are placed on the breasts, buttocks and thighs; grafts to increase the size of the lips; huge extensions in the hair; eyelashes larger than usual; exaggerated makeup; very short clothes; more defined muscles. And, in addition, what attracts the most attention: they have physical and biological characteristics that classify them in social standards as belonging to the feminine and masculine simultaneously. In addition to all the deconstruction of the limits that divide female and male, these bodies go beyond, expose themselves and subvert social rules. David Harvey (1992) cites Foucault when referring to the obedient bodies that social standards require in various institutions, such as schools, prisons, asylums, panopticons. And it is against this standardization, punishment and order that these prostituted, sexualized (or hypersexualized), transvestite and transsexualized bodies move. Especially when the sanitary intention in the streets, in squares, in cities, since the 19th century, was present. The aim was to create healthy, clean, young, sexually defined bodies (a transvestite or transsexual would therefore be unthinkable) and scientifically improved, in order to avoid diseases, and create a “superman” (IACHTECHEN, 2009, p 78). After all, “one dreams, in the body and in the city, of the absence of risk.” (HISSA; NOGUEIRA, 2013, p. 62). To understand who were the characters who were closest to the health speeches, and which were close to the groups that did not fit into this white, clean and healthy body, it is necessary to understand the scenario in which Curitiba found itself, more specifically, Damn Mouth, located in Praça Osório – the place where Gilda spent most of her time. Praça General Osório received this name in 1879 to honor soldier Manuel Luiz Osório, a participant in battles in the Paraguayan War. The square, very tree-lined, has busts of poets from Paraná and a fountain brought from Paris. Currently, it also contains a sports court, changing rooms, public toilets, chess tables and even gastronomic and craft fairs at certain times of the year, making it one of the city's tourist attractions. There you will also find “Boca do Brilho”, a place with 19 shoeshine boys who work near cafes and newsstands, generally polishing the shoes of retired gentlemen, politicians, lawyers, businessmen, who sit there chatting, reading the newspaper and drinking coffee, a practice carried out since the time when Gilda walked around the square. The space known as “Boca Maldita” appeared in an unspecified area in Praça Osório, on December 13, 1956, created by a primarily male group of artists, professionals, sportsmen, politicians and retirees, with the aim of getting together to discuss various subjects published in newspaper headlines, mainly. Among the founders is Anfrísio Siqueira, also president of Boca during Gilda's time, and one of the people who made the most efforts to remove her from the place. On the one hand, this male group belonging to Curitiba's middle classes kept themselves busy walking, looking at the street movement, and, above all, maintaining their good intellectual image, very well dressed and within a group of privileged people who occupied the street. with a sense of ownership, exposing their socioeconomic class and their power to interfere in this space. On the other, transvestites, like Gilda, who either slept in shelters or found their beds in marquees. Sick, dirty, ragged, smelly, aimless, without documents. The latter are the characters that Baudelaire portrayed so much in his poems, in addition to resembling, in a certain way, the figure of the artist portrayed by Baudelaire: someone who has already lost his aura, who sees his The space known as “Boca Maldita” appeared in an unspecified area in Praça Osório, on December 13, 1956, created by a primarily male group of artists, professionals, sportsmen, politicians and retirees, with the aim of getting together to discuss various subjects published in newspaper headlines, mainly.

The latter are the characters that Baudelaire portrayed so much in his poems, in addition to resembling, in a certain way, the figure of the artist portrayed by Baudelaire: someone who has already lost his aura, who sees hishalo falls into the mud and who is no longer compatible with sacred, holy images; and yes, the common man, of everyday life. This contrasting environment began, mainly, from the moment of the institutionalization – although not limited by closed spaces, but excluding – of Boca Maldita, in which these gentlemen exchanged sexist jokes with the transvestites on the street. Known for her scandalous and intimidating manner, she did not let anyone offend her, having been involved in some fights. What bothered these gentlemen most, especially the president of Boca, was that Gilda broke all the rules imposed by the group and did not give up on conquering that space: Gilda, her body, her practices, her life were the experience of maladjustment, the untranslatable, the unnameable. As she arrived, she lived in Curitiba: beggar, bearded, effeminate. Male and female in one flesh and dressed in gala in full sunlight, the city was waiting for her for another day of show. She loved to dance. And in front of the record stores on Rua XV de Novembro she didn't hesitate. (SIERRA, 2013, p.92). Gilda transgressed the modernizing capital; its time-space and its body-city relationship were different: slow, extravagant, brilliant, dancing, playful, hybrid and disturbing. She was at odds with the conservative city that sought to create the image of a smiling city, sincere, toothless, bearded and smeared with red lipstick, she scandalized groups such as those concentrated in Boca Maldita. Even though he was a rare figure of his time, this image in the city is not unique, as it is mixed (although alone) in the great crowd of other common bodies in the metropolis that, from time to time, insist on emerging and transgressing this urban space.

> Final considerations
> Understanding the participating elements of Modernity and Post-Modernity in the city is a complex task, but fundamental to understanding which bodies transit through this city, as well as understanding that the city emerges through looking at urban bodies. The transgressive body here was understood, based on the image of the Curitiba transvestite Gilda, as one that circulates freely through the spaces of the city, determining its own space-time. Sometimes it appears to be contradictory to what is normally found in these environments, and which relates to sexuality and living with other bodies in a different way. Her image contrasts with the conservative and cold modernizing city, and this extravagant and playful body, which asked for coins and offered kisses, is not limited to the prevailing bodily and sexual imprisonments. It is generally the body that bothers, that overflows, that goes beyond the limits of the other, often for its own survival, as is the case with Gilda. It was noticed that this cross-dressed, drunk, wandering, beggar, prostituted and dirty body was at the mercy of exclusions and violence at a certain time when Curitiba was growing in many ways and needed to assert its image as a “model city” , especially in spaces like Boca Maldita, a place destined for a few: men, heterosexuals, successful people. But, even in the midst of all the setbacks, he did not get rid of this present, living and, above all, uncomfortable body. And it reverberated so much, to the point where artists tried to rescue their memory – created through their interference – through songs, shows, videos and performances. These interventions were carried out by Gilda in the streets, squares and carnivals of the city and which, although they were just ways found by the transvestite to have fun or to survive, encouraged local artists and artists from other regions to record their passage through the capital. Gilda arrived and left in an unknown manner, but not without leaving a spark of fire burning among many passers-by in the city, especially artists, who even today seek to relive her story and prevent the performative character from falling into oblivion.
