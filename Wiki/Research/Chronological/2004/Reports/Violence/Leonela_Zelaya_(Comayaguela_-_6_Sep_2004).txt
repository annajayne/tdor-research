> REQUEST FROM THE IACHR
> 
> According to the analysis of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the case refers to the international responsibility of the Honduran State for the death of Leonela Zelaya .

> In this sense, the Commission concluded that the State is responsible for the violation of the rights to life, personal integrity, private life, honor and dignity, freedom of expression, equality and non-discrimination, as well as to live free of violence.
> 
> The Merits Report was notified to the State of Honduras on April 11, 2022. The IACHR reported the granting of seven extensions for the State to comply with the recommendations of said report.
> 
> However, the Commission observed that, two years after the notification, Honduras has not complied with the recommendations issued by the Commission.
> 
> For this reason, the Commission decided to submit the case to the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court, given the need to obtain justice and reparation for the victims.
> 
> Among the main requests of the IACHR are: comprehensive reparation for human rights violations through the adoption by the State of measures of economic compensation and satisfaction.

> 
> And the implementation of non-repetition mechanisms such as the adoption of legislative, administrative or other measures to achieve recognition of the self-perceived gender identity of trans, non-binary and gender diverse people, among others.
> 
> In that sense, in the opinion of Indyra Mendoza , the State of Honduras requires “political capacity” to make the necessary structural changes and avoid human rights violations and being taken to an international court, since the lack of action is observed. and concrete measures to protect trans people and guarantee justice for victims of violence.
> 
> The recent IACHR report emphasizes the differentiated violence faced by sexual dissidents. It points out that there is a high rate of cases of violence against LGBTIQA+ people in Honduras, many of which, according to information from civil society, remain unpunished.
> 
> As a result, crimes against the life and integrity of LGBTIQA+ people reach 93% impunity. Of the 194 LGBTIQA+ people murdered between 2017 and 2022, only 13 cases obtained a conviction.
