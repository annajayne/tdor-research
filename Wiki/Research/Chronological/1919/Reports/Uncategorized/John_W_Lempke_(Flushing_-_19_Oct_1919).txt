On the evening of Oct 19th, 1919, around 6:30pm, the body of 21 year old John W. Lempke, son of very wealthy Long Island iron founder William J. Lempke, was discovered hanging from a rafter in the cabin of their motorboat dressed in a gingham house dress, lingerie, silk stockings, a corset, and black dancing pumps. John 's body was discovered by their mother, who went looking for them after they failed to show up for a planned supper for William J. Lempke's birthday.

John's hands had been tied with slipknots,  legs secured with rope, and an oilcloth hood was over their head tied around the neck by a rope in a hangman's knot. There was no reported evidence of a struggle.

Police declared it a suicide several hours later, but this was strongly disputed by the family. An investigation over the next two months was inconclusive, with the police still leaning toward suicide while acknowledging that there were unexplained circumstances such as how John could have tied themselves up so completely, and no absolute evidence either for or against either murder or suicide.
