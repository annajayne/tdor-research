MYSTERY OVER DEATH OF YOUTH

New York—John W. Lempke of Flushing, aged 21, was murdered on Sunday under strange circumstances. He went out as usual on Sunday in his motor boat on Long Island sound. His mother became alarmed and made a eearch. She was told of a motor boat adrift. Seeing that the vessel apparently had no hand at the steering wheel and that the engine was not running, she became more anxious about the safety of her son and finally succeeded In reaching the craft. 

On the deck of the boat was the body of Lempke, although who saw it first were unable to recognize it. 

His clothes were gone and instead he wore woman's apparel. Every piece of clothing appeared to have been put on carefully and apparently had been donned by the murdered man before death in some spirit of mimicry. The first impression of the police was that the clothing had been put on the body by murderers to hide identity, while some other persons were escaping in Lempke's clothes. 

The hands were tied tightly behind the back with a thin but strong piece of rope and the feet were bound In the same way, with knots that gave evidence of having been tied by some person familiar with the knots of seamen who handle sailing craft. No marks of violence were apparent on the body at the first preliminary examination and apparently death had been caused by suffocation. 

A large piece of oilcloth from the galley of the boat, carefully folded, had been drawn tightly around the neck and head and tied with a rope of the same kind that had been used in binding the hands and feet. So intricate were the knots binding the cloth around the neck of the victim that the police removed it only with great difficulty. It seemed to have been the cause of death and apparently had been tied on tne body after Lemjpke had been bound hand and foot.
