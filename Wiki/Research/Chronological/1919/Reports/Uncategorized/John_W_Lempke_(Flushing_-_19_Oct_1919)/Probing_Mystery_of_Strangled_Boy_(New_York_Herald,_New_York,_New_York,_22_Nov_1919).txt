In addition to examining fourteen witnesses in the John Doe inquiry into the death of John W. Lempke, who was found In woman's attire and strangled on his boat In Flushing Bay October 19, the Queens District Attorney's office at Long Island City yesterday was investigating two clues which detectives hoped might throw light upon the ownership of the clothes and how they got on the boat. 

Assistant District Atorney William J. Morris said that unverified Information had been recieved that a fourteen-year-old girl In a Flushing store had identified the picture of young Lempke as a person to whom she had sold an article of women's underwear. The girl, according to the report received by the authorities, said that the purchaser put on the purchased article in the store and danced around in such a fashion that it frightened her.

Another report was that a wrapper corset cover and shoes sold at the store of Charles Rubin, 164 Forest avenue, Flushing, are possibly those found upon the dead youth's body. A careful check is to be made to make certain that there is no mistake in the identification of the articles sold by that store and If possible to learn the purchaser.
