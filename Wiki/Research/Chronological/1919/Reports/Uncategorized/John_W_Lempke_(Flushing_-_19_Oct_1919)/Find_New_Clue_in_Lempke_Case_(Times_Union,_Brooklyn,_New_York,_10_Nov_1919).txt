===== FIND NEW CLUE IN LEMPKE CASE =====

==== Search of Detectives Extends Into New England ====

Flushing, Nov. 10.—After twenty-two days of fruitless Investigation a definite murder clue hase been found in the mysterious death of John W. Lempke, it was said today. Lempke was found strangled aboard his motorboat off College Point and his body found dressed in woman's clothing. 

A letter was received by A. W. Thompson. He is the Lempke's physician and lives directly across the street from their home. Without divulging its contents, Dr. Thompson said that a more thorough investigation should now reveal much that has hitherto been unknown.

The letter was posted in Manhattan In the vicinity of Ninety-first street, and is not considered the product of a crank.

The many Investigators now at work are seeking the whereabouts of young Lempke's former sweetheart. The two quarreled and separated, following the discovery that the young woman had been the victim of a vicious attack by a man prominent in the city affairs of Flushing. She is wanted to throw as much light on the mystery of Lempke's life as she can.

No suspicion is directed toward her, but it is believed that she may furnish information which might justify the police in placing this man under arrest. She is now in a town not far from Boston.

Ten thousand dollars reward has been offered by William E. Lempke for information which will lead to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of his son. He is convinced his boy was slain.

Following a consultation held at Police Headquarters, Capt. Arthur Carey, in charge of the investigation, sent twenty of the older and more experienced men of the department out on the case. Added to this array of detective talent, detectives from the Flushing station were given secret orders by Deputy Police Commissioner Lahey and went scurrying forth to run down a number of new clues.

Private detectives in the employ of the family held a consultation in Mr. Lempke's home and mapped out a program of activity for this week which will shift their immediate investigation to certain points in Connecticut and Massachusetts.
