===== Identification of Shroud Clew in Lempke Mystery =====

==== Merchant Tells of Selling Ginham in Which Body Found on Boat Was Wrapped ====

A Flushing, L. I., shopkeeper yesterday identified the gingham wrapper in which the body of John W. Lempke was garbed when discovered dead aboard his boat at College Point, as one he sold about a year ago. The police would not say whether the merchant remembered to whom he had sold the garment. Dennis Sullivan, of Stapleton, S. I., described as a "rope expert," went to police headquarters, accompanied by a private detective in the employ of Lempke's father, and trussed himself up in the manner in which the youth's body was found, in an endeavor to disprove the suicide theory.

Captain Carey, head of the homicide bureau, watched the demonstration, but made no comment.
