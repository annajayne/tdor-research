===== LEMPKE'S DEATH REMAINS A MYSTERY =====

==== Unsolved, O'Leary Admits, Favoring Suicide Theory. ====

District Attorney O'Leary, of Queens, yesterday confessed himself unable to clear the mystery of the death of John W. Lempke, whose body, clad in feminine apparel, was found suspended from the roof of the cabin of a motor boat four weeks ago. He announced that every possible clue had been run down without success and that as far as his office was concerned he was through with the case.

"There are many facts that lead to the conclusion of suicide," said Mr. O'Leary. "There are none that lead definitely to any other determination. Some incidents remain unexplained, and are apparently inexplicable. In the majority of homicide cases this is true. There are no facts that definitely point to any crime having been committted."

Mr. O'Leary added that the presumption, without facts, favored the suicide theory, but that is presumption only.
