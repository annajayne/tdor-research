===== TO START LEMKE PROBE THURSDAY =====

==== Twenty Persons Called in John Doe Proceedings ====

==== MYSTERY NEAR SOLUTION? ====

==== Girl, 14, May Be Important Witness at Hearing. ====

District Attorney O'Leary, of Queens, today assigned Assistant District Attorney William J. Morris to the investigation of the Lemke mystery, which will be started, probably Thursday, at tho Queens County Court House.

The District Attorney has received from Police Captain Carey a list of about twenty persons, all of whom will be summoned and examined In John Doe proceedings. It was rumored in Long Island City today that among the persons thus summoned will be a fourteen-year-old girl, hitherto unnamed in the investigation, who may be able to shed definite light upon the matter of the woman's clothes which Lemke wore when the body was found.

Flushing, Nov. 18.—The announcement by District Attorney Denis O'Leary yesterday that he would conduct a thorough investigation into the mysterious death of John W. Lempke, who was found strangled on his motorboat in Flushing Bay, off College Point shore, on Sunday evening, October 19, was received with a great deal of interest by the dead youth's parents and others interested in the case. The parents believe that Mr. O'Leary's action will go a long way toward solving the mysterious death of their boy whom they insist was murdered.

Mrs. Lempke said today that the offer of a reward of $1,000 to the per son who can present evidence to convince Mr. Lempke that his son committed suicide would hold good. She said that while the police have been advancing theories for the young man killing himself, they have failed to present any real facts in the case.

Mrs Lemke took occasion to deny that a certain man very well known in Flushing and who has beqn mentioned in the case ever had a quarrel with her boy, so far as she knew. This man who is still a resident of Flushing formerly taught in one of the local schools. It had been reported that he and young Lemke quarreled after Miss Ellen Bellows, Lemke's former sweetheart, declared she had been wronged by this man. Mrs. Lemke said she did not believe this man knew anything about her son's death.

"We have offered to let the police make a thorough search of the house for any women's clothes which they can find here," said Mrs. Lemke, "but they have not taken up the offer. If the police have found where any of the clothe were bought why don't they come out with the news? If John wanted to wear women s clothes he could have had the finest silks and satins instead of the course material that was found on his body."

Mrs. Lemke said that a report had been circulated about Flushing that her boy was seen making faces at himself while standing in front of a. mirrow in his home. She said that this report originated after her son had been seen standing in front of a mirror removing blackheads from his face after shaving.

Another report that the family held a $20,000 policy on their son's life was also denied by Mrs. Lemke who stated that he had been insured for only $1,000.
