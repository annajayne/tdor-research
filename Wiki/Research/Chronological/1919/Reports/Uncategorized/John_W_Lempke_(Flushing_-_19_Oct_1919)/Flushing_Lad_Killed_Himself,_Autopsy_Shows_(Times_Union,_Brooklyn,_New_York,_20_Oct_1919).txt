===== FLUSHING LAD KILLED HIMSELF, AUTOPSY SHOWS =====

===== Doctor Says Lempke Tied Rope Which Strangled Him. =====

Suicide, not murder, is the medical examiner's decision as to what caused the death of John W. Lempke, 21, of Flushing, who was found strangled in the cabin of his power boat last evening. 

At the conclusion of an autopsy over the body Dr. Charles Norris, chief medical examiner, announced that his death was due to strangulation from a noose around his neck. He said that it was evident that he had tied the noose himself. It was a sailor's noose which only a sailor would be likely to know, and Lempke was In the Naval Reserve. The report that he had drank lysol is unfounded. No trace of any of the poison was found in his system. Dr. Norris said that the rope had been broken and not cut. 

John W. Lempke, 21-year-old son of William E. Lempke, wealthy manufacturer, of 221 South Parsons avenue, Flushing, was found dead at 6:30 o'clock last evening in the cabin of his 36-foot double-decked cruiser Mildred J., 2d, Flushing Bay, about three hundred feet from the foot of Eleventh street, College Point. 

Young Lempke's body was found by his mother, Mrs. Louise Lempke. When she entered the cabin of the cruiser, her boy's body was lying on the floor with a rope tied tightly about his neck, his feet tied together and his hands tied with a heavy rope. There was a black fishing bag over the boy's head and lying on the floor a short distance away was a bottle containing lysol. 

The body was clothed In women's wearing apparel, consisting of women's underwear, corsets, black shoes and stockings and over all was a gingham house dress. 

The boy's father, who is a member of the firm of Sexauer and Lempke, proprietors of an iron foundry In Vernon avenue, Long Island City, declares that his son was murdered and that he plans to have a complete investigation made of the case. Mr. Lempke strongly denies that his son took his own life, but believes that when he entered the cabin of the cruiser yesterday afternoon he was set upon by a gang who dressed him up In women's clothes and then murdered him. 

Young Lempke, who served six months In the United States Naval Re-

serves, and was discharged about six months ago and then took a position as draughtsman In his father' office, left his home in South Parsons Avenue, in one ot the best residential sections of Flushing, at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon, telling his mother and sister, Miss Mildred J. Lempke, after whom the boat was named, that he was going for a ride on his motorcycle. The boy drove to College Point and after placing his motorcycle in a shed on the property of Charles Tewes, who has a mineral water plant at the foot of Eleventh street, he started down the dock to get a rowboat. 

On the dock he met Henry Suffert, 26, of 27 Sixteenth street, College Point.

"Where are you going?" asked Lempke.

I'm going out to help Fred Hess fix his boat," replied Suffert. 

"Jump in my skiff and I'll row you out," Lempke told Suffert. Suffert accepted the offer and they started out towards Hess' boat which was anchored about fifty feet from Lempke's cruiser. After leaving Suffert on Hess' boat, Lempke continued on to his own. 

Both Suffert and Hess told the detectives of the Flushing Precinct that Lempke entered the cabin of his cruiser at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon and that they did not see him again. They left Hess' boat at about 6:30 o'clock and came ashore. 

When Lempke did not return for his dinner at 6 o'clock last night, Mrs. Lempke decided to go In search of him and in company with her daughter they motored to College Point. Charles Tewes rowed Mrs. Impke to her son's cruiser while Mildred remained on shore. 

Boarding the cruiser, Mrs. Lempke looked down into the cabin and saw the prostrate form of her son on the floor, his head about two feet from the flywheel of the engine. Tewes did not board the cruiser and Mrs. Lempke did not tell him of the sight she had witnessed. Instead she re turned to shore and telephoned to her husband to drive to College Point. He arrived in another automobile in. a few minutes and rowed to the cruiser.

Mr. Lempke then notified the police and Capts. Kelly and Graham and Detectives Eugene Fallon, James Kiernan and William Newburg hurried to College Point and boarded the boat. They summoned Dr. Vincent Williams, of Thirteenth street and Eighth avenue, College Point, who after an examination declared that the young man's death had been due to strangulation. 

Mr. Lempke told the police that he believed his son had been murdered. He said that he had no reason to kill himself and that he enjoyed everything he desired, motorcycle, automobile and boat. He said that there must have been someone on the cruiser when his boy boarded it and that he was attacked after entering the cabin. 

Capt. Kelly, in expressing his belief that young Lempke committed suicide, declared that it looked as though the rope about the boy's legs, hands and neck had been tied by the boy himself. The body was found lying on its aide. One arm was tied behind the back and the right arm was resting on the boy's stomach. There was a slip knot about each wrist. Capt. Kelly was unable tn state whether or not the boy had drank any of the lywol, but Capt. Graham discovered a mark on the boy's face which, he said, resembled a burn which may have been caused by lysol. 

An investigation of the cabin showed that the clothes, which young Lempke had worn when he left his home, were lying on a bench not far from where bis body was found. These clothes consisted of a sailor's blue trousers. white blouse, brown cap, white underwear, brown low cut shoes and black socks. In one of the trousers' pockets was found the um of $44.88 in cash. There were no marks on his body, the police say which might Indicate that he was attacked. 

How he happened to be attired in women's wearing apparel neither the police nor Mr. Lempke could explain. Neither could say to whoim this wearing apparel belonged.

Detectives from the homicide bureau were notified, and conducted an investigation and about 1 o'clock this morning Dr. Charles Norris, Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York, arrived on board the cruiser. After making a cursory examination of the body, he announced that he would conduct an autopsy at 11 o'clock this morning In the city morgue at First avenue and Twenty-ninth street. Manhattan. 

Detective Fallon early this morning question Suffert and Hess, who were working on a boat about fifty feet from Lempke's cruiser. . Both of them declared that they did not hear any' noise of struggle oh Lempke's boat during the afternoon and said that they were sure if he was attacked by anyone they would have heard the noise.

His friends say that Lempke was a quiet young man and that he always traveled alone. He took a great interest in his boat and during the summer months went out in it two and three times a week. 

Miss Lempke was salutatorian of the June graduating class of Flushing High School but was unable to attend the commencement exercises because of illness. 

Mr. Lempke is well known throughout Queens. He is a member of the firm of Sexauer & Lempke, proprietors of an iron foundery in Veron avenue, Long Island City. His home is one of the most pretentious in ones of the most restricted neighborhoods in Flushing.

Mrs. Lempke told a reporter for the Times today that she did not believe her boy committed suicide. 

"Why, It's ridiculous," she said. "He had everything to live for. He had never complained or appeared despondent. I believe that he was attacked when he boarded the boat and shall see that a full Investigation is made. I have ordered my physician, Dr. A. W. Thompson, of 224 South Parsons avenue, to examine his body today."
