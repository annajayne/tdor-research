===== TAKE NEW TACK IN LEMPKE CASE =====

==== Police Seek Teacher With Whom Boy Had Quarrel. ====

Although the police stick to the theory that young Lempke committed suicide, it was said yesterday that they were looking for this man in the hope of obtaining from him information regarding a quarrel he is alleged to have held with Lempke some time before his death.

This man Is said to have been friendly with Ellen Bellows, former sweetheart of the Lempke boy, Misa Bellows was a student in the school where this man taught and it was reported she had been seen in his company quite frequently. He represented himself as a single man, while living here, but is said by those who knew him that he was married at the time, but was not living with hls wife. Another report stated that he had since been divorced and has married a young woman who taught in one of the Queens schools. The couple are said to be living in Manhattan.

It was reported early this week that Miss Bellows had identified the wrapper founds on Lempkes body as belonging to the wife of this man, but in a statement made yesterday in New Haven, Conn., she denied the alleged interview.
