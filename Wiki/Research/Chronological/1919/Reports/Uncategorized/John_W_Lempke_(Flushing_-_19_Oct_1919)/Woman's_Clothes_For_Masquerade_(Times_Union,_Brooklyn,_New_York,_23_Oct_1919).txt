===== WOMAN'S CLOTHES FOR MASQUERADE =====

==== Invitation May Explain Rig Which Lempke Wore. ====

Flushing, Oct. 23.—Funeral services were held at 10 o'clock this morning at his late home, 221 South Parsons avenue, for John W. Lempke, 21 years old, who was found strangled to death on his cruiser in the Flushing Bay, off College Point, early Sunday evening. The services were private and were attended only by the immediate relatives and frends or the dead youth. He was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery, Flushing.

Both the police and William E. Lempke, father of the youth, are continuing their investigations, the father to prove his assertion that his son was murdered and the police to locate the owner of the woman's clothes in which young Lempke was attired when he was found by his mother. As yet, neither the police nor Mr. Lempke have been able to obtain any clue.

One of young Lemnke's associates said yesterday that the youth had planned to attend a masquerade party last Sunday evening in the Ravenswood section of Long Island City, where the Lempke family lived before coming to Flushing. If this is true, it may help in solving the presence of the feminine garb which clothed the youth's body. The dead youth's friend thought that Lempke had gone to the boat to try on the clothes, but he would not hazard an opinion as to how he met his death. The parents of the Lempke youth said they did not know of the party which their son was to have attended and they cannot tell how the clothes happened to be on the boat.
