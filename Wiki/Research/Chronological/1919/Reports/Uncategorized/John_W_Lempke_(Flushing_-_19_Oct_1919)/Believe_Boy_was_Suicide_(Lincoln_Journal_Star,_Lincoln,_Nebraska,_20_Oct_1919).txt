===== BELIEVE BOY WAS SUICIDE =====

==== Police Maintain John Lempke Killed Himself—Relatives Equally Sure He Was Murdered. ====

NEW YORK, Oct. 20.—The police maintained today that John W. Lempke, twenty-one, committed suicide; his relatives were equally certain he was murdered.

The boy's body, clad in woman's clothes—a gingham house dress, silk stockings, corsets and lingeries—was found last night on the deck of his power boat near his home, off College Point.

His hands were tied behind his back with ropes and his legs were bound. A piece of oil cloth covered his head and was secured about neck with a short piece of rope. A bottle containing a virulent poison was found nearby but there were no burns about his face to indicate he had swallowed any.

A preliminary examination indicated the boy had been strangled.

An autopsy was to be held today. Lempke was last seen alive rowing out to his boat with another boy about 1 o'clock yetserday afternoon. His companion is said to have put Lempke aboard his boat, which was moored a hundred yards from, and then to have proceeded to an- otber boat. Lempke's mother found the body.
