===== UNUSUAL MURDER MYSTERY =====

==== New York's Detective Force Trying to Solve Killing of John W. Lempke. ====

New York. Oct. 20.—Police detectives were today attempting to solve one of the most unusual murders or suicides ever brought to their attention. The body of John W. Lempke, aged 21, son of a wealthy Flushing, L. I. manufacturer, was found on his motor boat fully garbed in a woman's clothing, even to lingerie and a corset. He had been strangled to death. The rope was around his neck when the body was found.

After their first examination the police were inclined to the suicide theory. The parents of the dead boy vigorously denied this. They said he had been murdered.
