===== UNSIGNED LETTER SUGGESTS NEW LEMPKE CASE WITNESS =====

==== Man Named Hiller Summoned by Grand Jury—Morris Expects Important Evidence To-Day. ====

An unsigned letter received by District Attorney O'Leary of Queens, Saturday, may untangle the Lampke com.

The letter said a man named Hiller of East 34th Street, Manhattan, could aid greatly the "John Doe" investigation of the Grand Jury which is trying to establish whether John W. Lempke was murdered or died a suicide. Accordingly, Hiller has been summoned to appear before the Grand Jury to-day.

What Hiller can tell is unknown, but Assistant District Attorney William J. Morris intimates that something will "break" to-day that will aid in clearing up the mystery death on the Mildred J, II. Oct 19, last. Lempke's body, attired in woman' apparel, was found hanging.

Six police officials, the medical examiner, Prof. Edward Marquad, and seven other witnesses will appear before the Grand Jury to-day, in addition to Hiller.
