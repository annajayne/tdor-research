===== DRESS HE WORE IS LEMPKE CLUE =====

==== Flushing Police Concentrate Efforts on Clothing ====

Flushing, Oct. 22.—Further investigation yesterday by the detective ot the Queens Bureau under the direction' of Capt. Herbert Graham failed to give any clue regarding tne mysterious death of John W. Lempke, son of William E. Lempke, of 221 South Parsons avenue, Flushing, who was found strangled in the cabin of his cruiser in the Flushing Bay off the foot of Eleventh street, College Point, early Sunday evening. 

It was reported last night that a resident of College Point whose home is in Eleventh street had stated that he saw a light on the Lempke cruiser about 2 o'clock Sunday morning. If it is true that there was a light on the boat at that hour and that there was someone on board the boat, the theory that the youth was. murdered will be strengthened considerably. The father said last night that he had not heard of there being any light on the boat early Sunday morning, but that he would investigate the report

The funeral services for young Lempke will be held at his late home tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, and will be private. He will be buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery between Flushing and Corona.

Capt. Graham said today that he welcomed any investigation that might be made by private detectlves.

"Our investigation now consists wholly of trying to find the person who owned the clothes which the Lempke boy wore when he was found," said Capt. Graham. "There were no marks on any of the clothes which will help us in our investigation We intend to continue our probe and any co-operation from Mr. Lempke or any private detective agency will be welcomed." 

The investigation yesterday disclosed that young Lempke had ridden on his motorcycle Sunday morning to the home of a friend, George Schrader, of 278 East Seventy-sixth street, Manhattan, and that while there he accepted an invitation to attend a Hallowe'en party, which was to be given next week. Lempke's sister, Mildred, was also to have been a guest. Sunday was Lempke's father's birthday, and upon his return from a motorcycle ride, just after dinner, he was to take his parents and sister out in the automobile for a ride.

Another thing which the police have learned was that there was a rifle and a box of cartridges on board the boat Sunday. None of the cartridges had been used. The belief has been advanced that the boy Intended to use this rifle on a hunting trip which he planned to take to Great South Bay with another Flushing youth the latter part of the week.

A report published in one of the Manhattan papers yesterday to the effect that a Mr. Hutchins, of Locust street. Flushing, had seen a burly man in a rowboat near the Lempke cruiser a short time before the youth's body was discovered waa not given any credence by the detectives investigating the case.

This man was seen In the East River, off the foot of First avenue, College Point, the detectives say, which is more than a mile from where Lempke met his death and is in an entirely different section of the town.
