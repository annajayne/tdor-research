===== RELATIVES IN BOAT MYSTERY CLAIM MURDER =====

==== Medical Examiner's Verdict of Suicide Fails to Satisfy Family of John W. Lempke ====

"Suicide by strangulation," said Chief Medical Examiner Charles Norris after completing an autopsy yesterday on the body of John W. Lempke, twenty-one, son of a wealthy Flushing iron manufacturer, who was found dead dressed in woman's clothing and bound hand and foot, aboard his powerboat in Flushing Bay Sunday night.

"Foul play," say relatives and friends of the boy, pointing to the following mysterious facts: 

	He was choked to death by a rope around his neck—but it is said there was nothing from which be might have hanged himself aboard the boat.

	His hands were bound and his head muffled in an oilcloth.

	No member of the family ever saw the clothing in which his body was found dressed. So far as known there were no such garments aboard the boat and young Lempke carried no bundle with him when he boarded it.

Police Capt. Herbert Graham of the Seventeenth Inspection District will continue investigating the myster, determined to establish a motive IF the case was suicide and the bring the culprits to justices IF it was murder.
