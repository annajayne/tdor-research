===== BOY CLAD AS A GIRL FOUND SLAIN IN HIS POWER BOAT =====

==== Mother Finds Body of John W. Lempke of Flushing ====

==== Hanged in Cruiser's Cabin—Mystery in Fate ====

==== of Masquerading Youth. ====

John W. Lempke, 21 years old, left his home in 221 South Parsons avenue, Flushing, Queens, yesterday about noon and told his mother and father, William. J. Lempke, that he was going fishing in his power boat which then was moored about 300 feet off the foot of Eleventh street, College Point. When he left home the boy wore a sailor's uniform and a pair of low black shoes.

The next time anybody saw Lempke, so far as the police have ascertained, was just after noon, when Charles Tewes saw the boy and another youth, who appeared to be about the same age, rowing out to the power boat.

Lempke had told his mother that he would be home for supper, and when he failed to appear she became alarmed. Later the boy's father and mother and his sister, Miss Mildred Lempke, went to the foot of Eleventh street in their automobile. There they saw the power boat, a thirty-six foot cruiser, some distance off shore. Miss Lempke obtained a skiff and rowed out to tho boat, with her mother as a passenger. There was no sound as they neared the power craft and no answer to their shouts. Finally they boarded the craft.

There was nothing on deck to indicate that young Lempke was about. Mrs. Lemnke then went below to the cabin. There, according to Capt Herbert Graham of the Queens Detective Bureau, Mrs. Lempke found tho body of her son. It was hanging by the neck from a rafter and was fully clothed in the dress of a woman—a gingham house dress, with women's lingerie, black silk stockings, and even a corset. On the floor of the cabin was another pair of long silk stockings and a pair of women's dancing pumps:.  Hanglng In the cabin behind a curtain was the clothing that young Lempke had worn when he left home, with $44.88 in the pockets. So far as his mother knew that was all the money he had when he left home.

Mrs. Lempke, the police declare, left the body hanging in the cabin and went back to shore with her daughter. Then Mr. Lempke accompanied them to the power boat, cut down tho body and carried it to tho deck. When the detectives reached the scene they found the boy's body, still arrayed In women's clothing, lying on the deck of the cruiser, with the right arm tied in front of the body with a slip knot and the left arm tied behind tho body with a similar knot. Around the neck was a length of rope tied in a hangman's knot. There were no bruises, but the police say that there was a small burn on the boy's face, near the mouth, which might have been caused by lysol, a bottle of which was found in the cabin. 

Mrs. Lempke said last night that she had not admitted to the police that the boy's body was hanging in the cabin when she found it and that his father did not cut it down. The body was lying on the cabin floor, she said, and had already been cut down when she got there. She also declared that there was a canvas bag pulled down over his head and shoulders, which the police say they know nothing about.

Both Mrs. Lempke and her husband declare that the theory that their son committed suicide is ridiculous. They believe he was murdered, although both of them said that so far as they knew he had no enemies.

The boy's father is a member of the firm of Sexauer & Lempke, iron founders, in Long Island City. The son was employed by the concern as a draughtsman.
