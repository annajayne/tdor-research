JOHN W. LEMPKE 

The strange death of John W. Lempke, a wealthy youth of Flushing, L. I., whose body was found dressed in woman's clothing aboard his power launch, the Mildred II., off College Point, several days ago, has caused the young man's family to demand a thorough police investitgation of the affair. Chief Medical Examiner Charles Norris, who performed and autopsy, says that the 21-year-old youth committed suicide and the strangulation caused his death. Relatives of Lempke declare, however, that there is not the slightest evidence to warrant the theory of suicide.

On the contrary, they say, every scrap of evidence points to deliberate murder. According to the police Lempke's hands were securely bound behind his back and a rope tied around his neck when the body was found in the body of the launch.
