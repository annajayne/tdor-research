===== MADE LEMPKE WRAPPER =====

==== Manufacturer Ascertained, but the Seller Still a Mystery ====

The gingham wrapper in which the body of John W. Lempke was clothed when it was found on board his motor boat at College Point, October 19, was manufactured by Jacob Krimsky ot 19 East Broadway, Manhattan. This fact was developed yesterday during the course of an investigation by William J. Morris, Assistant District Attorney, at the Queens county court house.

Testimony that they had sold clothing such as worn by Lempke was given by A. Richland, a shoe dealer at 63 Main street Flushing; Mrs. Minnie Isaacs, 321 Thirteenth street, College Point; Morris Isaacs at 86 Broadway, Flushing, and Mrs. Rose Shaurer of 110 Thirteenth street, College Point. But they could not identify the person to whom they had made the sales.
