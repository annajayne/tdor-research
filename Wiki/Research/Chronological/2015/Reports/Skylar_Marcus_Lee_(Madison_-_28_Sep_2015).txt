suicide



> A 16-year-old trans boy from Madison, Wisconsin, died Monday after taking his own life. According to an obituary posted on the Cress Funeral Service website, Skylar Marcus Lee was a third-year student at Madison West High School who belonged to the Gay-Straight Alliance school and loved ballroom dancing.
> 
> Lee battled depression and mental health issues and scheduled a Tumblr post for 6 a.m. the morning of her passing. In the post, Lee detailed his desire to commit suicide, but emphasized the desire to avoid becoming a symbol: 'Don't turn my name into a hashtag.' While not mentioned in the post, that line is a clear reference to Leelah Alcorn, the 17-year-old trans teenager whose death last December sparked a national conversation about conversion therapy. 
> 
> A memorial will be held in Madison on Friday. On the Cress site, friends and family left commemorative notes remembering an energetic young person who had a great impact on people's lives.
> 
> Lee's death adds one more name to the list of LGBT teens whose suicide deaths interacted with social media this year. In May, a genderqueer teenager Kyler Prescott died after battling depression and bullying online. Sixteen-year-old trans girl Taylor Alesana took her own life after documenting the bullying she experienced on her YouTube channel. In scattered incidents, several trans teens also committed suicide earlier in the year, each posting notes or videos about their plans on social media.




> MADISON -
> Skylar Marcus Lee on September 28, 2015 succumbed to a quiet killer that some may already be familiar with: depression. When not fighting against his own internal mental health he was a junior attending Madison West High School. An active member of GSA, Proud Theatre, he also actively did advanced ballroom dancing and was an activist for LGBTQ and intersecting identities. He loved the world and the people inside it, trying to fix it every day of his life.
> 
> Skylar was born in Madison on November 28, 1998 to James and Joanne Lee. He is dearly missed by his parents, his brother Avi Z., his grandmother Ok Park, and Nugget, a beautiful dog.
> 
> A gathering celebrating Skylar's life will be on Friday, October 2, 2015 from 3 - 6 PM at Cress Funeral Home, 3610 Speedway Road, Madison, WI. Stories will begin at 5 PM.
