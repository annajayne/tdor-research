suicide

> I have been contacted by a classmate of a Trans boy who died of suicide in 2015, who is believed to have been bullied until he couldn't take it. His name was Sage Quigley Norman from Encinitas, CA and he was 15. The person who contacted me was upset that suicides aren't included in the most cited TDoR list, and also that Sage was deadnamed and misgendered.
