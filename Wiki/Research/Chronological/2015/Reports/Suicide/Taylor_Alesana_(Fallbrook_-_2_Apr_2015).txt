> Transgender Teen Commits Suicide After Tortuous Bullying
> By Laura BeckPublished: Apr 11, 2015 1:19 PM EDT
> 
> Taylor Alesana, a transgender 16-year-old from Fallbrook, California, committed suicide on April 2, ABC News reports. On her popular YouTube channel, the teen recounted horrifying tales of bullying that forced her back in the closet. She says, "I've lost tons of friends, tons. And it's been hell. I go to school every day, and I get my lunch and I sit down alone."
> 
> The North County LGBTQ Resource Center said Alesana didn't get much needed support from her family and friends. "With few adults to turn to, and with no support from her school, her life became too difficult," the group said. "Taylor was a beautiful and courageous girl, and all she wanted was acceptance."
> 
> As Daily Mail reports, Alesana is the seventh transgender youth reported to have committed suicide this year in the United States. Heartbreaking.
