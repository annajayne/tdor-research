heart attack


> Morganna Love is a Mexican artist from San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Mexico. A soprano, actress, and, according to Forbes 2020, one of the most powerful women in her country, Aleizah Morganna Martínez Bautista (by her legal name) has worked in everything from opera to film, standing out for her activism in highlighting the stories of trans women. In "Rosario Tijeras," she works hand in hand with Bárbara de Regil in a friendship that takes them through the greatest drama. "Diario El Comercio. Todos los derechos reservados."
>
> Transgender women's storylines on Mexican television are becoming increasingly common. In "Rosario Tijeras," Morganna plays Sirena, a stylist and singer who finds "Chayo" (Bárbara de Regil), recovering from an explosion after the events of the third season, and saves her from death. The fourth season also tells the story of love and the mafia between Sirena and El Papi (Luis Fernando Peña), the leader of a neighborhood cartel, a relationship that is almost impossible due to the homophobia and ambition of the series' antagonists. "Diario El Comercio. Todos los derechos reservados."
>
> Sirena's styling is a tribute to my best friend Gaby del Río, who died of a heart attack in 2016. She was a stylist, and we would spend hours talking while her clients arrived. This character was deeply connected to that part of the story. "Diario El Comercio. Todos los derechos reservados."



> This interview was conducted on the same day Paola was murdered and days before the death of Gaby del Río, who died on Saturday, October 15th, as a result of a heart attack. Gaby was a fervent defender of the rights of the trans community, and with this text, we pay a small tribute to her for her contribution to Mexican freedoms.
> 
> To better understand this story, we must go back to an early 1980s afternoon at the Hidalgo metro station in what was then Mexico City. Gaby del Río was walking quickly, carrying a Hawaiian outfit she had bought minutes earlier for a performance, when, at the turnstiles, two police officers stopped her, one of them asking, "Are you coming with us?"
> 
> Alarmed, she replied, "Tell me why." "You hit a customer," the officer stated. "Listen, that's not..." She tried to defend herself, but the officers grabbed her arms and forced her out of the station.
> 
> Gaby had heard rumors about the raids against prostitutes and homosexuals, and before that day, she thought they were fake. "I'm here because I'm effeminate," Gaby realized as she rode in the patrol car toward the Cuauhtémoc district. "Those operations happened in the city, even though it's abhorrent to think about it now," she says today, still annoyed, recalling that unofficial action that brought her hours of fear and frustration.
> 
> Gaby del Río sits in one of the chairs at her beauty salon in the Obrera neighborhood, wearing a black blouse and pants, her blond hair loose, and a little makeup. She recalls that the waiting room was packed with gay men and trans women. They were photographed, and although she tried to cover her face, the police ordered her not to. "There was no education about human rights. You had to resign yourself and say, 'He touched me, too bad,'" she laments, adding that, among those detained, a trans woman shouted, "This shouldn't happen, it's not right!" "In a way, she opened my eyes, but it was still a long time before I took any real action," she says.
> 
> "It's hard to think about that reality of three decades ago," I comment.
> 
> —Yes, because today we're experiencing a boom in trans girls. A lot of work has been done. There's more activism. At first, gays did their thing, and I respect them, because they were the first to rise up in Mexico City. They fought for their rights, but being trans wasn't well-regarded, not even among diversity groups. We were relegated, the worst. People, derogatively, called us "dressed." For about 15 years now, there's been a more homogeneous unity in Mexico City. In the provinces, there's still discrimination; it's not easy to see trans people on the streets.
> 
> Much has been achieved in the capital, Gaby celebrates. There are laws for equal marriage and gender identity, but, "although there has been change, the war is not won. There are always people against it. Today we are experiencing marches in favor of the classic family. Being violated for your preferences is crazy. Many of us have been attacked." Gaby says that a few days ago, a friend was walking through the streets of the city and a group of biological women yelled at her not to deceive herself, that she was neither a man nor a woman, but an abominable gay man.
> 
> Gabriel was a restless, effusive little boy who despised the boys' toys his parents gave him. He preferred the dolls of his eight older sisters, and that was a good thing; no one in the family denied him that right or judged the obvious: that their youngest son was homosexual. That's what they believed. His father worked all day to cover the expenses, his mother took care of the house, and Gaby had fun, ignorant of the outside world in the Lorenzo Boturini neighborhood of Mexico City.
> 
> A crooked, effeminate boy who preferred the company of girls at recess deserved the scorn and bullying of his classmates. "Society imposes a role on you, but I didn't feel comfortable in front of a urinal, or with the chatter of men in elementary school, middle school, or high school. No," Gaby emphasizes. She also didn't leave her house to play: the girls treated her like a boy, and she didn't want any trouble with others. "There was a conflict."
> 
> The difficulties due to her feminine behavior began when she left home. The school where she attended elementary school only allowed adolescent students who wanted to complete their studies. Gaby was nine years old, and 16-year-old boys sexually harassed her. She couldn't talk to anyone about it: she was threatened with beatings, and her parents were busy with family duties.
> 
> Over the years, the family considered her the gay son, brother, and uncle, and Gaby also assimilated that way, even though she didn't fit in at gatherings with homosexuals. She didn't know she was a trans woman. Gay was the only concept she knew, and she refused to be "dressed" because, at that time, within the illness that was considered homosexuality, dressing up meant chaos, the worst. "The word was derogatory. If you were dressed up, it meant they were going to kill you."
> 
> Her mother had been a singer for years and was friends with gay men who were beaten and sent to jail, especially if they dared to wear women's clothing. Because of this, she was overprotective, but she couldn't prevent her daughter from being locked up in a segregated group at 19 for the crime of not behaving like a man should.
> 
> That time in the early 1980s, Gaby's father and sister went to the police station to rescue her, and the authorities claimed she was arrested for prostitution. When the MP questioned her, she replied that she was on the subway because she was heading home after buying a dance outfit. "Oh, so it was because of the bush, your hair is very long. How many times have you been here?" Gaby, outraged, said, "Never." "Well, we'll give you a chance." A mandatory fine was necessary to release her.
> 
> "That moment left its mark on me. I was very scared, but it made me understand many things. All of that has armored me up, because now I stand up for myself and fight for human rights and diversity," says the 48-year-old trans woman. Indeed, Gaby danced Hawaiian and Tahitian. As a child, she studied dance and fashion design, and although she entered university, she put it aside to dedicate herself to dancing. Since she was young, she has taught classes for quinceañeras. Today, she is a member of a musical group where she sings and is a master choreographer.
> 
> She came out at 22. Her transition began a decade later, and gay friends encouraged her to make the decision: "You must be a woman by now," they said. At family gatherings, a sister would tell her: "You're not comfortable, this isn't your world." Gaby dared to wear feminine clothing from time to time, but the fear of criticism weighed heavily. "My family realized I was different before I did. I wasn't fulfilled."
> 
> More than 25 years ago, her friend Roshell Terranova realized Gaby wasn't gay and suggested she participate in drag shows. Given her corpulent physique, she could easily have played Lola Beltrán. She always wanted to wear dresses and makeup, and she immediately accepted. From then on, she dedicated herself to drag every weekend at 14 de Ecuador, a gay bar in the Historic Center, and Gaby del Río performed so naturally that in the following months she was hired at other gay venues and expanded her acting catalog: Lucha Villa, Celia Cruz, Alaska, Sonia López, Amanda Miguel, Tina Turner, and Gloria Gaynor.
> 
> Inevitably, her family would notice her nightlife, and she received their advice: "Be happy." "I was still afraid of people, especially since there were already rumors in the neighborhood that I was a dresser. I claimed it was for work, but I loved it."
> 
> Meeting other people with similar preferences strengthened her. One day about 17 years ago, Gaby woke up in bed, aware that it would be a busy day. Her backbreaking work at the beauty salon wouldn't give her a chance to return home to get ready for an evening event, so she decided to dress up, put on her makeup, and head to her business. "I thought, 'If I feel good in women's clothing, why not? If I continue to be afraid of what people will say, I'll never be happy.' I promised my mom I would be, and I wasn't."
> 
> Clients and friends had already seen her transformed, but, according to them, Gaby was a gay boy who played at cross-dressing. Gaby says: "When they saw me dressed full-time, they stopped talking to me; they didn't go to the beauty parlor anymore. Being gay was fine, but not trans. That's how people are. Relatives, especially nephews and nieces, rejected me. Not anymore. I'm the aunt, but at first it wasn't like that."
> 
> Those who rejected her were few, and Gaby finally felt happy, calm, and fulfilled. Medical transition came later, "but the important thing is that I was me again. Performing shows helped give me courage. It was my shield."
> 
> Gaby del Río once again criticizes the marches in favor of conventional families, and I tell her that gays and lesbians who intend to adopt, despite everything, are more visible, and it's not common to talk about trans mothers. She responds: "That's because, I insist, we only recently began fighting for our rights. In the first marches in favor of gays, there were no trans people, because they were seen as the worst. How horrible to be excluded for being different. We emerged as activists in the late 1990s."
> 
> "Who does a trans girl want to start a family with?" I ask.
> 
> —In my case, with a heterosexual man, who doesn't stop being heterosexual if he settles down with a trans woman. They've told me so. I'm heterosexual too, but there's a range of possibilities. Many things aren't clear. The vast majority of trans people suffer from not having a partner: they live double lives or don't formalize their relationship with us due to social criticism. There are lesbian trans people, who like trans people and biological women, but they're more discreet. There are also bisexual people or those who prefer homosexuals. That's why it's inconspicuous to talk about dad, mom, and children as the only family.
> 
> She also criticizes the new LGBT generations: "It seems to me that the majority haven't had the opportunity to express themselves more politically. I'm not complaining, but I wish they'd realize what they have. We need to strengthen the self-esteem of diversity. We lack rights, especially for trans people. Why aren't same-sex marriages understood and respected by everyone, even though the Court ruled in its favor?"
> 
> —What does it mean, today, to be trans?
> 
> —It's power. Today we're all very empowered, because going out on the streets as trans people is activism, even though many don't participate in marches or demonstrations in front of the Chamber of Deputies, as I've done with many colleagues to demand gender identity. We need to integrate diversity into public education, and there needs to be openness in the media. We need to change the laws, because we're not doing well in the workplace and in education. We need to remove transsexuality from the mental illness spectrum.
> 
> —What advice do you give to trans women?
> 
> —May they be strong and earn a place, because this life is complicated. Above all, may they be productive.
> 
> Gaby recalls that society believes a trans person can only aspire to prostitution, opening a beauty salon, or doing drag, and that "assaults in sex work are a constant; this profession leaves many marks."
> 
> Her sex worker friends have been subjected to constant abuse: "They're beaten and thrown things, in the best-case scenario. The worst is murder. Some trans people are aggressive, but that's because of their life story; they grow up with violence, stigma, and imprisonment. Activists suffer similar stories. Many criticize our unfriendly behavior, but with these backgrounds, you can't be nice all the time."
