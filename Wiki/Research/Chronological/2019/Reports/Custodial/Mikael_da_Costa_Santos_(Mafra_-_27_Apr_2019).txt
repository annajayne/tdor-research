> Mikael da Costa Santos, 26, was killed in April 2019 by four inmates who allegedly simulated a possible suicide by the victim
> 
> A hanging crime that occurred inside the Mafra Prison, in the Northern Highlands, in 2019, led to the conviction, following a complaint by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Santa Catarina (MPSC), of three men, two of them for qualified homicide by futile motive and cruel means and for the related crimes of being part of a criminal organization and procedural fraud. A third defendant was convicted of being part of a criminal organization. The fourth defendant died during the course of the proceedings, and the state's punishability was declared extinguished.
> 
> The sentences applied to the two defendants convicted of double-qualified homicide were 21 years, two months and 12 days of imprisonment in a closed regime, plus seven months and six days of detention in a semi-open regime and the payment of 40 days' fines, and 24 years, one month and 10 days of imprisonment in a closed regime and another eight months and five days of detention in a semi-open regime, in addition to the payment of 42 days' fines.
> 
> The third defendant was acquitted of the crimes of homicide and procedural fraud, but was convicted of being part of a criminal organization and was sentenced to six years, two months and 20 days of imprisonment in a closed regime and the payment of an 18-day fine.
> 
> The Sentencing Council partially accepted the MPSC's complaint and sentenced the defendants according to the crimes committed by each of them. The sentence is subject to appeal and the Court granted the defendants the right to appeal while free, if they are not imprisoned for other reasons.
> 
> UNDERSTAND THE CASE
> 
> As described in the public criminal action filed by the MPSC, in the early hours of April 27, 2019, inside the Mafra Prison, the defendants tied a pair of pants around the neck of the victim, Mikael da Costa Santos, 26 years old, a transgender person, and killed her by asphyxiation. Faced with the crime, the defendants confessed to the prison officers.
> 
> The complaint states that “the crime against life was committed for a futile reason, since the perpetrators of the criminal act, members of a criminal faction, committed the crime of homicide because the victim had “snitched” on some illicit conduct committed by the organization, both inside the public prison in Mafra and in the penal establishment in Joinville, thus harming the criminal activities of the group”.
> 
> The records show that the defendants used cruel means to commit the crime of homicide, as they suffocated the victim to death, thus causing unnecessary suffering.
> 
> The MPSC's indictment also states that the defendants, in an attempt to hinder the investigation of the crime by misleading the expert, prepared the scene simulating that the victim, who had a history of attempting to take her own life, had committed suicide inside the prison.
> 
> Still in the action, the 2nd Public Prosecutor's Office of the District of Mafra reports that, on the afternoon before the homicide, the victim told the prison officers that she was being threatened with death by the defendants. She, in her own handwriting, wrote two memos asking to be transferred to a different cell, which did not happen.
