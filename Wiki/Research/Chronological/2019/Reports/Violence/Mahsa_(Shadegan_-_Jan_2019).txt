murdered


> Mahsa, a 27-year-old trans woman who had reassignment surgery a few years ago, was murdered by her father, brother-in-law, and cousins in the desert near Shadegan in January 2019. According to the Shesh-Rang report, Shadegan police arrested Mahsa's father on counts of complicity in premeditated murder and arrested Mahsa's brother on murder charges. Because the matter concerned members of the same family, there was no one entitled to “blood money,” so Mahsa's father was simply released and did have to serve time in jail or settle any fees.
