===== PROTEST POLICE HARRASSMENT OF GAYS =====

Twenty-four people marched on Saturday, December 18 to protest police harrassment of gay people. Most of the protestors were from gay liberation groups.

The marchers began at the Chicago Gay Alliance house at 171 W. Elm St. They were in very good spirits as they chanted and leafletted their way via Division St., Rush St., Bughouse Square, the Playboy Building, and the Lawson YMCA, ending with a one-hour picket in front of the 18th District Police Station on Chicago Ave. Women marched in front.

Some of the chants were: 
	"ho, ho, homosexual, the ruling class is ineffectual."
	"Two, three, four, five. Stop this pig harrassment jive."
	__"Hey, hey, hey. Remember James Clay."__
	"Gay, gay power to the gay gay people. All power to the people."
	"Unite to fight gay oppression."
	"Ho ho, hey hey, homosexuals are here to stay."

 Many radical groups, especially in the Lincoln Park and Lakeview neighborhoods, were contacted before the march and urged to go from "Lip service" of gay liberation to "foot service," meaning joining the march. But only two people-one woman active in women's liberal and one man active in a radical Jewish group â€” joined the gay people.

The following leaflet was handed out along the way and presented to police officers at the 18th District Station:

TO THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT, 18th DISTRICT STATION

The gay community of Chicago protest the intensified campaign of harassment directed at them by 18th district police in the past months. This warfare on gay people must be stopped!

WE DEMAND THE RIGHT TO BE GAY ANYTIME AND ANYPLACE!

In order to guarantee our freedom to live we demand of police:

1. STOP harassment of gay men through enticement and entrapment and arrests on the charges of solicitation.

2. STOP sexual extortion of gay women. Incidents have been reported where lesbians wearing gay liberation buttons were told they would be charged with loitering unless they submitted to officers' sexual demands.

3. STOP the intensified harassment of third world gays. At present they are subject to more frequent arrest, heavier charges and more severe sentencing, often for the "crime" of walking through mainly white neighborhoods.

	__JAMES CLAY, A BLACK TRANSVESTITE, WAS MURDERED NOVEMBER 25,1970, BY POLICE OFFICERS JAMES FINNELLY AND THOMAS BOWLING HAVE NEVER BEEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL!__

STOP demanding sex from, arresting, beating & killing transvestites. Arresting gay people for wearing "attire of the opposite sex" is as ridiculous as arresting straight women for wearing "male attire."

5. STOP intimidating and arresting gay people for showing affection in public. Gays get arrested for holding hands and kissing; heterosexuals would never be noticed for these acts.

6. STOP callously standing by while gay people are being beaten and maimed almost daily by uptight straights.

7. STOP demanding payoffs and raiding gay bars. At present, bars are the only institutions where we can gather and act as gay people.

8. APPOINT a group of ombudspeople chosen by the gay community to communicate their complaints to the police. This group should have equal numbers of women and men and half of each should be third world gays.

As a first show of willingness to change we further demand that a police-community workshop be scheduled no later than one month from today in order that the police department can enumerate the changes in policy they have made in response to us.
