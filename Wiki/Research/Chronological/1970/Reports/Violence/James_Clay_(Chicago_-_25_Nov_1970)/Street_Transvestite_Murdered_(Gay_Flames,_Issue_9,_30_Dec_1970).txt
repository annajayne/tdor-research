Street Transvestite Murdered

The night before "Thanksgiving", the Chicago pigs showed us what we Gays have to be thankful for. "James" Clay, a transvestite, was murdered in cold blood by James Finnelly and Thomas Bowling, two of Daley's "finest" facsists.

Clay, "in women's clothes", was standing by the street early in the morning. The policeMEN say he was trying to flag down motorists. Finnelly knew Clay. He had arrested him before. The fact that our half-sister was back on the streets was a tremendous insult to his cock priviledge. So he tried to arrest Clay. Supposedly, Clay ran.

According to the pigs, they tracked him down into an apartment house where he slashed out with a knife and got away. They "shot to prevent his escape."

Eight shots in the back killed James Clay. He cannot tell his story. We can't either but we can say one thin. Clay was in "men's" cloths when he was killed. When did he change? During the chase???

Street transvestites are the most exposed part of our community. Generally, their occupation is sexual prostitution rather than manual or mental prostitution. To find customers for this illegal business they must place themselves where they are subject to police attacks. Thus, like Clay, they often have long records. His included charges for soliciting, battery, resisting arrest, assault, and transvestism. The pigs use half-sisters to take out their hatred for those of us they can't reach so easily.

So Clay died for us. But we can't mourn. We must come closer together. We must act or build for future action. And we must prevent more deaths. We must remember James Clay.
