===== Why Should We Live In Fear? =====

We the transvestites of Chicago and of the United States want equal civil rights! Why should we have to live in fear in our own ways of being? Why shouldn't we have equal job employment? Why should we have to be employed in fear and discontent in order to keep our jobs with a lie, rather than with the truth? Why should we have to be harassed by pigs when going thru a sex change? Why should we have to be under the pig's commands and demands when met in the streets?

We have formed the Transvestites Legal Committee-No. I, to have, in the municiple code of Chicago, taken out: section 198-2. "Any person who shall appear in a public place in a state of nudity, or in a dress not belonging to his or her sex, with intent to conceal his or her sex, or in an indecent or lewd dress, shall be fined not less than 20 dollars nor more than one hundred dollars for each offense. No. 2-to insist on equal application of the law to those straight women who wear men's clothing. Why aren't they arrested? If this sounds stupid to you then you should see how stupid it is to arrest transvestites!!! No. 3-to protect and help all transvestites in Chicago and thruout the country with legal aid.

With the aid of a transvestites legal committee and the support of others in Chicago and all over the country, this can be done. __This will prevent cases such as the transvestite James Clay, who was trying to get home and was met by the pigs (James Finnelly & Thomas Bowling) who said she pulled a knife on them, and that was their excuse for shooting him in the front of the head, the back of the head, the neck, the chest, the stomach, the penis, etc., a total of eight **times //until she was dead!!//** And what happened to the pigs Finnelly and Bowling? NOTHING!__

The Transvestites Legal Committee works with The Chicago Committee on Gay People and the Law. 24 hour service for incoming calls when we need help or legal advice. From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. call 312-939-2493. 6 p.m. to midnight, call 312-947-9346. From 12 midnight to 9 a.m.-emergencies only-call 312-947-9346. For membership and donations, write or send to: Transvestites Legal Committee, 21 E. Van Buren, suite 601, Chicago III. 60605.
