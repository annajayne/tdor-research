STONEWALL Means Fight Back!

By Denise Harmon
Milwaukee Gay Caucus of YAWF

On June 29,1969, the police attacked the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in New York City. The raid was not unusual, but the response was, because for the first time gays fought back in a rebellion that lasted three days. The raid was not unusual because all through history gay people have been beaten, harassed, drugged, and even murdered for being gay. __Only a few years ago James Clay, a Black transvestite from Chicago, was shot down in cold blood by the racist cops simply because he was Black and gay.__

The New York cops claimed that the Stonewall was supposed to have a state liquor license, but in actuality since the Stonewall was a private lounge, it was not required to have one. The police marched into the bar and announced the raid, and then started to release the customers one by one. Instead of running away, the gay customers stayed outside to await the outcome of the raid, and soon 400 gays gathered.

Many people, including gays, think that men started the Stonewall rebellion, but this is not exactly true. As the cops were arresting three gay men, those standing by were yelling threats and curses. Then the cops made the mistake of attempting to arrest a gay woman. She fought back and called for her gay brothers' and sisters' help. The cops were met with bricks, bottles, cans, coins, fistsâ€”real gay power. The next night gay people from all over New York marched down Christopher Street in the first Gay Pride March in history.

In fact, for several nights running, large crowds of gay people challenged the right of the police to invade their social gathering places. The street battles that occurred as a result of continuing police harassment and brutality (with the police actually drawing their guns on one occasion) made it clear that gay people now had the consciousness to fight back when pushed too hard. The Stonewall rebellion was more than justified and long overdue.

The next year Gay Pride Week was called to commemorate the Stonewall rebellion with numerous marches, demonstrations, and rallies. And each year in cities all over the country similar celebrations are held.

Gay pride is gay unity, strength, and love for each other. It affirms our pride in ourselves and in our lifestyle. For us to come to the realization that our love is right and good is a beautiful and courageous act. Gay pride is also not feeling guilty about being gay, but feeling beautiful, strong in love, and unafraid. We refuse to be frightened any more. We must join with all our oppressed sisters and brothers, gay and straight, to build a new society, one where all can determine their own lives free from all forms of oppression.
