===== They Mean To Kill Us All =====

//"The police are not here to create disorder, they're here to preserve it."//
//                                                              — Mayor Richard J. Daley, 1968//

February 4, 1972, 20 year old Chicano Bruce Aguina is downstairs in the basement washroom of Walgreens drugstore at State and Madison. So is off duty police Sgt. James C. Johnson. Today, Bruce Aguina is buried in the ground. Johnson claimed he shot Aguina "accidently" when he tried to hit him in the head with his gun. Why did he want to slug Bruce with the gun? He was "making noise." The coroner's jury met and ruled "accidental death"

Ronnie Nelson, 17 year old greaser. Just stopping by a local hot dog stand. So was Richard Nuccio, cop. Nuccio shoots Ronnie dead. Claims the kid threw a knife at him. Ballistics tests show that Ronnie was shot in the back. Oh, says Nuccio, didn't I explain it right before? He threw the knife over his shoulder at me. From 50 feet away.

__James Clay, 24 years old and black was on his way home November 26, 1970. Policemen James Finnelly and Thomas Bowling shot him dead for the heinous crime of...being dressed in women's clothes! Nor was it enough to kill James Clay dead. Officers Finnelly & Bowling made extra sure the streets were safe for decent folk by pumping eight more bullets into the front of the head, the back of the head, the neck, the chest, the stomach and the penis.__

It's enough to write or read these words to make you puke. To know that these are true Chicago stories of real live people is something else again. Especially when you usually use the Walgreen's washroom yourself when you go downtown.

Every once in a while, we read in the papers about someone being killed by the cops. Once in a while, when the people killed were well known or overtly political, there's an outcry., lots of "investigations" but little else. Like with Black Panthers Fred Hampton & Mark Clark or Young Lord Manuel Ramos. But usually, folks just see an articia in the paper giving the cops side of the story, which is always "they pulled a gun (or knife) on me and I shot in self defense." What does it all add up to?.... 

An Attica happens in Chicago every year. It's not as dramatic because it's more drawn out than sudden — but as surely as Rockefeller's gestapo stormed the prison gates and gunned down those who had declared "we are men, we are not beasts" — just as surely, Chicago cops day by day bag their quota — just as surely some 30-odd people died at their hands every year.

Tuesday, March 28, 1972, the Chicago Law Enforcement Study Group, a joint project of the Center for'Ijrban Affairs of Northwestern University and 12 other groups, issued a 104 page report on "The police and their use of fatal force in Chicago," an investigation of the 79 "civilians" killed by cops during 1969 and 1970. What did they find out?

First they looked at the five largest U.S. cities. New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Detroit. In a nine month period, from July 1970 to March 1971, cops killed 32 people in Chicago — more than any of these other big cities, including New York, which has twice Chicago's population! In the same time period, 21 people were killed in N.Y., 13 in Philadelphia, 8 in L.A. and 4 in Detroit. That makes Chicago's death rate (adjusted for population) one and one half times the Philadelphia rate and //more// than //three// times the rate for New York, L.A. and Detroit. .

Of the 79 civilians killed in Chicago, 75% were black. — while only a third of the city's people are black. A black person living in Chicago was over six times as likely to be killed by police as was a white person. When the higher arrest rate for blacks is taken into account, the black death rate was still twice as high as that for whites.

And if you're under 25 years old, you're twice as likely to be shot down by the cops: 62% of those killed were under 25, 21.5% of those killed were under 18 years old.

If you're young and black too, you don't have to compute your percentage. You just duck when you see the squad car coming down the street.

The number of people killed cannot be accounted for by the arrest rate, the number of police, or the police death rate, the study showed. Chicago cops just shoot more.
