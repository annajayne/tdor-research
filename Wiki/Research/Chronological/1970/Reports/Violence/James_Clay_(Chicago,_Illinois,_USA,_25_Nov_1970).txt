James Clay was shot while she was on the way home Nov 25, 1970 by Chicago police officers James Finnelly and Thomas Bowling. Clay was shot eight times, including: In the front of the head, in the back of the head, in the chest, in the stomach, and in the penis.

The officers claimed Clay pulled a knife on them.

Neither officer was ever charged in the killing despite a large outcry from the gay community who believed that she had been killed by the police for nothing more than being Black and dressed as a woman.
