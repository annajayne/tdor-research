> The body of Thaddeus “Tad” Keegan Bradley was found 9 Sep 2021, in Willits, CA, but identified April 2023. Tad was identified as gender non-conforming and found in women’s clothing,  Their parent reported Bradley missing to the Arcata Police Department in July 2022, Note that we have not been able to determine Tad’s pronouns so we are using gender neutral they/them.
> 
> Toxicology results did confirm the presence of methamphetamine toxicity, however an examination of Bradley’s skeletal remains showed signs of perimortem injuries.  The cause of these injuries is unknown and unexplained thus far. The cause of death is unknown.  A book by Alister Crowly, a known occultist author and figure, was found near the remains. It is a book, but it has given rise to all sorts of speculation.
> 
> The coroner’s investigation thus far has determined Bradley, commonly known by the nickname “Tad”, was transient (on foot) and traveled between Humboldt County (Fortuna and Arcata), Trinity County (Weaverville) and Mendocino County over the last several years.  The locations in Mendocino County included the cities of Willits, Ukiah and mainly the township of Mendocino dating back to 06-24-2015 to the last known contact a Deputy had with him on 07-26-2021.
> 
> Thaddeus’ parent Bradley Bagwell is gender nonconforming man who lives in California. Their other parent remain in Texas. Tad was raised in San Antonio.  Just days after their birthday on June 21, 2012, they hit the road bound for the Pacific. They found himself “immersed in the Emerald Triangle street kid culture bouncing between Mendocino, Humboldt, and Trinity Counties.”
> 
> Tad’s parent said their son was trying to ‘find himself’ in the wilds of Northern California. They loved Arcata, they played guitar. Tad was described as a “good person with a kind soul.”  Emerald Triangle travelers who knew Tad actually reached out to the family offering memories of their friendship with them and their good nature.
> 
> Anyone with information that could assist investigators in this coroner’s investigation is urged to contact the Sheriff’s Office Tip-Line by calling 707-234-2100 or the WeTip anonymous crime reporting hotline at (800) 782-7463.
> 
> Tad’s death is the 27th transgender, nonbinary, or gender nonconforming person reported in 2023 to date. They are the second gender nonconforming person, an umbrella term used here because Tad was wearing clothing typically assigned to women. They are the sixth white person reported dead. Tad’s death is the sixth death reported from California. “Reported* is an important distinction to make as we know there are more folx whose deaths go unacknowledged.
> 
> Tad was injured by someone and then died. They didn’t deserve that. It doesn’t matter if they were using drugs or engaging in occult practices. They didn’t deserve to be left to die. The likelihood it was an accident grows more faint at the years pass by.
> 
> Rest in power, Tad. Your death was tragic both in how you were discovered and how your cause of death was misguided for two years. That’s a lot of time lost to pursue the truth, a truth you, your family, and your friends deserved. Thank you for the kindness and goodness you brought to this world, especially other travelers. I hope that somewhere in your journeys you found what you were seeking. I am so very sorry we did not create a safer world for you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
