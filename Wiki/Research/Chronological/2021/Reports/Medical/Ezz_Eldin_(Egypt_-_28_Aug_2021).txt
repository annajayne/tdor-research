Egypt
clinical neglect


> In the absence of government-sponsored gender-affirming healthcare, a dangerous and expensive underground medical industry has emerged resulting in unsupervised treatment in unlicensed centers, without avenues for accountability. Many transgender people in Egypt who seek surgery are left with no choice but to take this risk. On August 26, 2021, Ezz Eldin, a 26-year-old Egyptian transgender man, bled to death after he was prematurely discharged following a surgery in an underground clinic to affirm his gender.
> 
> Salma, a 27-year-old Egyptian transgender activist, said, “The Medical Syndicate’s sex reassignment committee stopped giving approvals, and transgender people who want to undergo surgeries had no choice but to do it in an underground hospital. Even before, Al-Azhar [Egypt’s religious authority] stood in the way of transgender people getting approval even if they had all the needed medical papers, as in their view only intersex people should undergo [sex reassignment surgery].”

> "He wanted to open a house. Open a project and take responsibility for it. He wanted his life to settle down and to have food and drink. He had the operation because he wanted to live, but he died."
> 
> With these words, human rights and gender activist Malak Al-Kashef began her conversation with Raseef22 about Ezz El-Din, also known as “Ahmed Fares” (26 years old), who died on Saturday, August 28, as a result of complications From sex reassignment surgery in an unlicensed hospital, according to her.
> 
> In the past few hours, Al-Kashif launched  a campaign demanding “justice for Ezz” through the hashtag  #Ezz_rights_where  on social media, accusing “a private doctor in a hospital under the stairs” of being responsible for his death because he “brought him out of the hospital with his wound open” and “gave him blood thinners that caused him severe bleeding.”
> 
> Al-Kashef blamed several Egyptian health institutions for what she described as Ezz’s “murder,” stressing that it was “systematic.” “It was all systematic: he didn't get a report that he had surgery in the hospital because the doctor knew that complications could occur that would result in Ezz's disfigurement or death,” she said.
> 
> “There are no opportunities for justice for trans people”... The death of a transgender young man from complications of sex reassignment surgery in an unlicensed hospital highlights the suffering of trans people in #Egypt once again. Activists ask  #Where_Izz_Rights
> Hope in "Life and Home"
> Regarding the reason for Ezz’s insistence on undergoing the operation, Al-Kashif said that the young man “suffered as every transgender person in Egypt does from the moment he begins to discover his identity and realizes the alienation within his body and his difference from the mold that his family and society force him to remain in.” 
> 
> She added that he suffered additionally "because his family did not accept his gender transition, as they took him to many doctors who prescribed him the wrong medications, and psychiatrists who hurt him a lot with female hormones at times, and frightened him by saying ' you will go to hell and burn and go crazy' or demanding that 'you go and wear a dress and you will feel like a girl' at other times."
> 
> Al-Kashif continued that Ezz left his family home to rely on himself and start an independent job and life, but he faced problems every time because of his identity, which forced him to change jobs and places of residence over and over again. 
> 
> Explaining why he risked undergoing such an operation in an unofficial hospital, she explained: “We spent years of our lives in government hospitals to obtain reports proving our eligibility to undergo the operations, and in the end we were told that the reports we had wasted Two years of our lives on were not enough and that we needed the approval of the Doctors Syndicate, which refused to do its job and give us approvals.”
> 
> Voice of the King of Detector.
> She denounced the inclusion of the Egyptian Medical Syndicate “an Azhar member who has neither studied medicine nor understood it in the sex correction committee to decide whether we should start living or not!”, continuing that “in the end, the committee does not convene “We do not obtain approvals, and years of our lives are wasted on earth, so we decide to perform the operation.” Secretly with doctors so that we can change our card and live... so that when we stand in an ambush, we will not be hit because our appearance and gender are not the same as those on the card, so that we can know We work, so that we can rent a house, so that we can walk in the street, so that if we get robbed and do not get anything, we can take our rights under the law, so that we can love, have relationships, and get married.”
> 
> Psychiatrists scared him that he would “go to hell, burn and go down in flames” and asked him to “wear a dress and you will feel like a girl”... Ezz El-Din (26 years old), a transgender Egyptian man, dies as a result of complications from a “sex reassignment” operation after which he hoped to have a “life and a home”
> She stressed that "the operation (sex correction) for us is a step towards life because before it you are in a glass cage, non-existent, invisible and inaudible."
> 
> Al-Kashef blamed “bureaucracy, the corruption of the health system, and the state’s refusal to treat trans people as human beings with rights” for “killing” Ezz, considering that the Doctors Syndicate, Al-Hussein University Hospital, and Qasr Al- Aini Hospital were complicit with the doctor who performed the operation on Ezz El-Din.
> 
> No hope for "justice"
> In the same context, Egyptian lawyer and human rights activist Nesma Al-Khatib participated in the demands for justice for Ezz, and she told Raseef22: “The one who bears responsibility for Ezz’s death is the Egyptian state because there is a committee specialized in granting gender correction permits to transgender people that should be convened, and it is not doing its work in a way that grants transgender people their rights that are guaranteed by the constitution and the law.”
> 
> “Ezz is not the first or the last person whose story will die with him until the state determines a safe mechanism for transgender people to correct their gender without fatal complications or permanent disabilities.”
> She added that "opportunities for justice are not available to transgender people" in Egypt, despite the fact that "Article 53 of the Constitution stipulates that all citizens are equal before the law and that there is no discrimination between them in rights, freedoms and public duties, and there is no discrimination on the basis of religion, gender, colour, language, disability, social status, etc.” 
> 
> Al-Khatib said that she was in constant contact with Ezz, including after the surgery, which took him about a week to complete, stressing that she could not file a lawsuit against the doctor because there was no proof that he had performed the first operation , and because Egyptian law limits this right to the family of the deceased only. She confirmed that there was a previous complaint from a transgender young woman against the same doctor for causing abdominal deformity during a corrective surgery as well.
> 
> Malak Al-Kashef to Raseef22: “If pride comes true, we will not have one pride, we will have a million pride... This happened because we have been trampled all our lives and have no voice.”
> The Egyptian lawyer described what happened to Ezz as “wrongful killing, the punishment of which is at the discretion of the judge,” hoping that the doctor would be punished, although she ruled that out because “Ezz’s family refused to file a complaint against the doctor in order to quickly complete the procedures and go and bury him in his hometown in Sharqia Governorate.”
> 
> While Al-Kashif considered that the solution lies in the Egyptian Ministry of Health and the Doctors Syndicate taking action to question the doctor in question, facilitate gender correction procedures, and resume his operations in government hospitals, Al-Khatib saw the necessity for the government to take a look at the transgender file in accordance with the requirements of Article 53 of the Constitution, and prepare a health and financial care program for transgender people. 
> 
> Al-Khatib continued: “Ezz is not the first or the last person whose story will die with him until the state determines a safe mechanism for transgender people to correct their gender without fatal complications or permanent disabilities.”
> 
> Al-Kashef concluded: “If the pride is true, we will not have one pride, we will have a million pride. Trans children will grow up, suffer, and go to a butcher doctor who will kill them. This happened because we have been trampled all our lives and have no voice.”
