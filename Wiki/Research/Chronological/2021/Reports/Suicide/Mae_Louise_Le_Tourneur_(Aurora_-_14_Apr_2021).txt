suicide


> Sakura and Mae were two trans women, married to each other, and they both attended a trans support group that I facilitated in Denver. We lost them both to suicide in 2021.

> She was very loving, touched a lot of peoples lives and meant everything to her spouse Sakura.

> Mae and I only worked together for a few months. She would stop by my desk daily to say hi and I always enjoyed our conversations. I miss knowing she was only an email away. Fly high pretty girl!

> They were always very kind and easy to talk to. She had made a positive impact wherever she went. I will miss her dearly. I'm happy I had the opportunity to talk and be a friend to her.

> Mae helped me through some rough times and I will miss her deeply.
