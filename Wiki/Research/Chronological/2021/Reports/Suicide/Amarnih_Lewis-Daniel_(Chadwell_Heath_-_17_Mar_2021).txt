> Amarnih Lewis-Daniel inquest: Verdict in trans woman's death
> 1st December
> 
> Jurors have returned their conclusion over the March 2021 death of Amarnih Lewis-Daniel at Highview House, Chadwell Heath. The inquest was held at East London Coroner's Court in Walthamstow.
> 
> Jurors in the inquest of Amarnih Lewis-Daniel have returned a narrative verdict, saying it is unclear whether she intended to take her own life.
> 
> But they chose not to make any comment on a series of missed opportunities in the weeks before her death to intervene over her deteriorating mental health.
> 
> They also made no comment on whether a years-long wait for a gender clinic appointment had contributed to her worsening mental state.
> 
> Amarnih, a 24-year-old trans woman, was found dead in a car park at the foot of Highview House in Chadwell Heath, where she lived, on March 17, 2021.
> The jury heard evidence that she was born male but began identifying as female from a very young age as she grew up in Walthamstow.
> 
> At the time of her death she had been on the waiting list for the Tavistock gender clinic for two-and-a-half years.
> 
> Amarnih’s probation officer testified that she complained constantly of the long wait and her eagerness to fully transition.
> 
> In the meantime, the court heard she had begun taking unprescribed hormones.
> 
> Jurors recorded Amarnih’s gender on their Record of Inquest form as female.
> 
> Asked to describe the circumstances of her death, jurors wrote: “Amarnih fell from the seventh floor window of her flat, [at] Highview House, Hatch Grove, Romford, on the 17 March 2021.”
> 
> The building is actually off of Whalebone Lane in Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, slightly over the border from Romford.
> 
> The jury’s narrative conclusion was: “Amarnih took the action that led to her falling from her seventh floor window. The evidence does not fully disclose whether she intended the outcome to be fatal.”
> 
> The court had heard how on March 17, the fire brigade was called to a blaze inside Amarnih’s flat, which she is believed to have started herself.
> 
> Her body was found in the car park underneath her lounge window. She had suffered severe head injuries, consistent with a fall from height.
> 
> Jurors were sent out to make a decision on Wednesday and, after continuing deliberations on Thursday morning, they returned a unanimous narrative conclusion.



> A transgender woman who exhibited erratic behaviour before her death was taking unprescribed hormones as she sat on a years-long gender clinic waiting list, a court has heard.
> 
> Amarnih Lewis-Daniel was referred to the Tavistock Clinic in August 2018 and was still on the waiting list by the time of her death in March 2021, her inquest was told.
> 
> Amarnih’s probation service officer had told jurors last week that she complained constantly of the lengthy waiting list.
> 
> In the meantime, Amarnih was receiving no treatment from her local mental health trust North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) for her gender dysphoria.
> 
> According to the NHS website, gender dysphoria "describes a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity".
> 
> Yet in police body cam footage shot weeks before her death, she was captured asking officers to retrieve her hormones from her flat before they took her into custody.
> 
> Jurors heard there was no evidence in her medical records of any doctor prescribing Amarnih hormones.
> 
> The police video was captured on January 29, 2021, as Amarnih was arrested for barricading herself inside her flat, smashing the windows and throwing furniture onto parked cars below.
> 
> An expert mental health doctor told jurors he could not say what impact the hormones might have had on her behaviour in the weeks leading up to her death.
> 
> Amarnih was found dead at the foot of Highview House, the Chadwell Heath tower block where she lived, on March 17, 2021.
> 
> A jury at East London Coroner's Court, Walthamstow, has heard that she repeatedly came to the attention of the authorities between January and March 2021 due to her erratic behaviour.
> 
> They have been tasked with determining whether Amarnih deliberately brought about her own death and whether the actions or inactions of any agencies contributed.
> 
> Expert witness Dr Duncan Harding, a forensic psychiatrist, described Amarnih as an “incredibly complicated” and “very complex” person.
> 
> In addition to her gender dysphoria, she was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and traits of emotionally unstable personality disorder. She was also awaiting an autism assessment.
> 
> With all of these conditions, said Dr Harding yesterday (November 27), Amarnih’s chosen gender was perhaps “the one thing in her life that made sense”.
> 
> But evidence from NHS England, read into the record by coroner Nadia Persaud, said: “Unfortunately, waiting times for a first appointment at a gender dysphoria clinic remain very high.”
> 
> As of September 2023, NHS England wrote, a patient attending their first appointment has waited an average of seven years.
> 
> The problem is due in part to a national shortage of gender specialists, the body explained.
> 
> “The services are massively stretched and struggling,” said Dr Harding, who does not specialise in gender services.
> 
> “Who knows what the effects of being on the waiting list for the gender dysphoria were,” he said.
> 
> “And… she was taking hormones. Who knows what effect they could have?”
> 
> He told barrister Sophie Walker, representing Amarnih’s family: “We are in completely unknown territory here. The fact that she’s taking medication which hadn’t been prescribed makes the situation that much more complicated – but I don’t know how it impacted on risk.
> 
> “The gender issue is obviously relevant to this case, but in a way that we don’t understand,” he said. “What would be good is to learn from this as best we can.”
> 
> Mrs Persaud asked Dr Harding if he felt there was anything local services could do to better support trans patients while they are stuck on waiting lists.
> 
> “It’s very, very, very difficult because it’s such a specialised area,” he said.
> 
> “If you’ve got specialised commissioning, do you really want to try and do a lesser version of it when you haven’t even got the diagnosis yet? It’s very complicated.”
> 
> He added: “Where we are at the moment is that there’s a massive waiting list.
> 
> “It’s a new field. It’s an expanding field. We’ve got a whole raft of young people coming up into adulthood with this issue and it’s really going to cripple services.”



> A gang of drunken transgender women who stamped on a teenager outside a Tube station have walked free from court.
> 
> Tamsin Lush, 29, Tylah Jo Bryan and Amarnih Lewis-Daniel, both 24, set upon the 19-year-old after he told them they needed female genitalia to be women.
> 
> Lush 'drop-kicked' the victim, named only as Al Shaheeb, and Hannah Bryan, 24, a mother-of-four and a friend of the transgender women, joined in as they booted the teenager.
> 
> 
> Jacinta Stringer, prosecuting, said the victim did not give a statement to police or cooperate after the attack.
> 
> She said he had also racially abused Hannah Bryan, calling her a 'black c***' during the incident at 2.15am on June 24, 2018.
> 
> Tamsin Lush (pictured), 29, Tylah Jo Bryan and Amarnih Lewis-Daniel, both 24, set upon the 19-year-old after he said to one of them they needed female genitalia to be woman
> 
> Ms Stringer said: 'He was 19 and described as Arabian. The young man came across these defendants outside Leicester Square Tube station.
> 
> 'Hannah Bryan, when she was interviewed described that there had been a conversation with this young man where he had turned around and said ''you're not a woman - you need a f**** to be a woman''.
> 
> 'That of course started an altercation. Tamsin Lush drop-kicked the male that had made that comment and he went to the ground.
> 
> 'The young man was on the floor and these defendants stamped and kicked him whilst he was on the floor.
> 
> 'Hannah Bryan came at a later stage and tried to pull them off, but was also seen trying to kick the male.'
