> Trans woman took her life while waiting for NHS gender services
> At the time of her death, Armanih Lewis-Daniel had been on the waiting list for an appointment at a gender identity clinic for more than two and a half years. (Canva)
>
> 
> A Black trans woman took her own life after waiting more than two and a half years for access to NHS gender services, a coroner has ruled. 
> 
> Armanih Lewis-Daniel, 24, died from fatal injuries in Hatch Grove, Romford on 17 March 2021, an inquest at Walthamstow Coroner’s Court found. 
> 
> At the time of her death, Lewis-Daniel had been on the waiting list for an autism assessment for almost two years and for an appointment at a gender identity clinic for more than two and a half years. 
> 
> According to Dr Duncan Harding – an expert instructed by coroner Nadia Persaud – delays in her autism assessment and accessing treatment for gender dysphoria “intensified Lewis-Daniel’s distress”. It was also noted that in the months prior to her death Lewis-Daniel told a probation officer it was having a “negative effect” on her wellbeing. 
> 
> During the hearing, Persaud said long NHS waiting lists for access to gender identity services “could intensify distress arising from gender dysphoria” and “there is little local support available to patients who are waiting for assessment and treatment by gender identity clinics”. 
> 
> The coroner said, as quoted by The Standard: “There was a lack of clarity as to who is responsible for the wellbeing of the patient during the waiting period, for any distress caused by the gender dysphoria. 
> 
> “Local mental health services have very little specialist knowledge as to how best to support a person suffering from gender identity dysphoria.
> 
> “There was a lack of clarity as to who is responsible for the wellbeing of the patient during the waiting period, for any distress caused by the gender dysphoria.” 
> 
> Coroner Persaud added there is concern that various NHS services are “not working optimally to support those during the lengthy waiting periods”. 
> 
> The inquest heard Lewis-Daniel had a “constellation of mental health difficulties”, including anxiety, depression and emotionally unstable personality disorder alongside her gender dysphoria. 
> 
> From January 2021, Lewis-Daniel’s mental health took a nosedive and she had contact with staff members from different departments at the North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) four times in the two months leading to her death. 
> 
> Red flags were raised to her probation officer following a “tumultuous” appearance in court on the morning of 8 March 2021. 
> 
> In his evidence to the coroner, Harding stated Lewis-Daniel’s death could have been avoided had she been referred back to an appropriate mental health team on any one of the occasions before her death. 
> 
> “In the months leading up to her death, Amarnih’s mental state declined, and she came into contact with the police, criminal justice system and mental health professionals,” Persaud said. “On the 17 March 2021 … Amarnih was still awaiting care from the Gender Identity Clinic when she passed away.”
> 
> Angela Lewis-Campbell, Lewis-Daniel’s mother, said her daughter was a “kind-hearted, protective and fiercely loving” person. 
> 
> “She knew what it was like to be bullied, and, because of this, she did everything within her power to ensure that others did not have to feel the way she did,” her mother said. 
> 
> Lewis-Campbell described how Lewis-Daniel dealt with the difficulties she faced as like “walking along the branch of a tree”, saying her daughter “felt strong and stable until at some point she simply could not take it anymore and she snapped”.
> 
> Lewis-Campbell is extremely critical of the police, saying racism and transphobia characterised the force’s interactions with her daughter.
> 
> “The police are trying to get away with this because they know they made mistakes,” she said.



> Amarnih Lewis-Daniel inquest: Verdict in trans woman's death
> 1st December
> 
> Jurors have returned their conclusion over the March 2021 death of Amarnih Lewis-Daniel at Highview House, Chadwell Heath. The inquest was held at East London Coroner's Court in Walthamstow.
> 
> Jurors in the inquest of Amarnih Lewis-Daniel have returned a narrative verdict, saying it is unclear whether she intended to take her own life.
> 
> But they chose not to make any comment on a series of missed opportunities in the weeks before her death to intervene over her deteriorating mental health.
> 
> They also made no comment on whether a years-long wait for a gender clinic appointment had contributed to her worsening mental state.
> 
> Amarnih, a 24-year-old trans woman, was found dead in a car park at the foot of Highview House in Chadwell Heath, where she lived, on March 17, 2021.
> The jury heard evidence that she was born male but began identifying as female from a very young age as she grew up in Walthamstow.
> 
> At the time of her death she had been on the waiting list for the Tavistock gender clinic for two-and-a-half years.
> 
> Amarnih’s probation officer testified that she complained constantly of the long wait and her eagerness to fully transition.
> 
> In the meantime, the court heard she had begun taking unprescribed hormones.
> 
> Jurors recorded Amarnih’s gender on their Record of Inquest form as female.
> 
> Asked to describe the circumstances of her death, jurors wrote: “Amarnih fell from the seventh floor window of her flat, [at] Highview House, Hatch Grove, Romford, on the 17 March 2021.”
> 
> The building is actually off of Whalebone Lane in Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, slightly over the border from Romford.
> 
> The jury’s narrative conclusion was: “Amarnih took the action that led to her falling from her seventh floor window. The evidence does not fully disclose whether she intended the outcome to be fatal.”
> 
> The court had heard how on March 17, the fire brigade was called to a blaze inside Amarnih’s flat, which she is believed to have started herself.
> 
> Her body was found in the car park underneath her lounge window. She had suffered severe head injuries, consistent with a fall from height.
> 
> Jurors were sent out to make a decision on Wednesday and, after continuing deliberations on Thursday morning, they returned a unanimous narrative conclusion.



> A transgender woman who exhibited erratic behaviour before her death was taking unprescribed hormones as she sat on a years-long gender clinic waiting list, a court has heard.
> 
> Amarnih Lewis-Daniel was referred to the Tavistock Clinic in August 2018 and was still on the waiting list by the time of her death in March 2021, her inquest was told.
> 
> Amarnih’s probation service officer had told jurors last week that she complained constantly of the lengthy waiting list.
> 
> In the meantime, Amarnih was receiving no treatment from her local mental health trust North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) for her gender dysphoria.
> 
> According to the NHS website, gender dysphoria "describes a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity".
> 
> Yet in police body cam footage shot weeks before her death, she was captured asking officers to retrieve her hormones from her flat before they took her into custody.
> 
> Jurors heard there was no evidence in her medical records of any doctor prescribing Amarnih hormones.
> 
> The police video was captured on January 29, 2021, as Amarnih was arrested for barricading herself inside her flat, smashing the windows and throwing furniture onto parked cars below.
> 
> An expert mental health doctor told jurors he could not say what impact the hormones might have had on her behaviour in the weeks leading up to her death.
> 
> Amarnih was found dead at the foot of Highview House, the Chadwell Heath tower block where she lived, on March 17, 2021.
> 
> A jury at East London Coroner's Court, Walthamstow, has heard that she repeatedly came to the attention of the authorities between January and March 2021 due to her erratic behaviour.
> 
> They have been tasked with determining whether Amarnih deliberately brought about her own death and whether the actions or inactions of any agencies contributed.
> 
> Expert witness Dr Duncan Harding, a forensic psychiatrist, described Amarnih as an “incredibly complicated” and “very complex” person.
> 
> In addition to her gender dysphoria, she was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and traits of emotionally unstable personality disorder. She was also awaiting an autism assessment.
> 
> With all of these conditions, said Dr Harding yesterday (November 27), Amarnih’s chosen gender was perhaps “the one thing in her life that made sense”.
> 
> But evidence from NHS England, read into the record by coroner Nadia Persaud, said: “Unfortunately, waiting times for a first appointment at a gender dysphoria clinic remain very high.”
> 
> As of September 2023, NHS England wrote, a patient attending their first appointment has waited an average of seven years.
> 
> The problem is due in part to a national shortage of gender specialists, the body explained.
> 
> “The services are massively stretched and struggling,” said Dr Harding, who does not specialise in gender services.
> 
> “Who knows what the effects of being on the waiting list for the gender dysphoria were,” he said.
> 
> “And… she was taking hormones. Who knows what effect they could have?”
> 
> He told barrister Sophie Walker, representing Amarnih’s family: “We are in completely unknown territory here. The fact that she’s taking medication which hadn’t been prescribed makes the situation that much more complicated – but I don’t know how it impacted on risk.
> 
> “The gender issue is obviously relevant to this case, but in a way that we don’t understand,” he said. “What would be good is to learn from this as best we can.”
> 
> Mrs Persaud asked Dr Harding if he felt there was anything local services could do to better support trans patients while they are stuck on waiting lists.
> 
> “It’s very, very, very difficult because it’s such a specialised area,” he said.
> 
> “If you’ve got specialised commissioning, do you really want to try and do a lesser version of it when you haven’t even got the diagnosis yet? It’s very complicated.”
> 
> He added: “Where we are at the moment is that there’s a massive waiting list.
> 
> “It’s a new field. It’s an expanding field. We’ve got a whole raft of young people coming up into adulthood with this issue and it’s really going to cripple services.”



> A gang of drunken transgender women who stamped on a teenager outside a Tube station have walked free from court.
> 
> Tamsin Lush, 29, Tylah Jo Bryan and Amarnih Lewis-Daniel, both 24, set upon the 19-year-old after he told them they needed female genitalia to be women.
> 
> Lush 'drop-kicked' the victim, named only as Al Shaheeb, and Hannah Bryan, 24, a mother-of-four and a friend of the transgender women, joined in as they booted the teenager.
> 
> 
> Jacinta Stringer, prosecuting, said the victim did not give a statement to police or cooperate after the attack.
> 
> She said he had also racially abused Hannah Bryan, calling her a 'black c***' during the incident at 2.15am on June 24, 2018.
> 
> Tamsin Lush (pictured), 29, Tylah Jo Bryan and Amarnih Lewis-Daniel, both 24, set upon the 19-year-old after he said to one of them they needed female genitalia to be woman
> 
> Ms Stringer said: 'He was 19 and described as Arabian. The young man came across these defendants outside Leicester Square Tube station.
> 
> 'Hannah Bryan, when she was interviewed described that there had been a conversation with this young man where he had turned around and said ''you're not a woman - you need a f**** to be a woman''.
> 
> 'That of course started an altercation. Tamsin Lush drop-kicked the male that had made that comment and he went to the ground.
> 
> 'The young man was on the floor and these defendants stamped and kicked him whilst he was on the floor.
> 
> 'Hannah Bryan came at a later stage and tried to pull them off, but was also seen trying to kick the male.'
