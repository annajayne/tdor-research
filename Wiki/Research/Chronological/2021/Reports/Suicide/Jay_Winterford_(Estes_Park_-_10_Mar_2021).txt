suicide


> A second suicide linked to the [Zizian] group is that of Texas native Jay Winterford, a trans woman who reportedly met Ziz at a rationalist meetup in Berkeley in 2016. By 2020, having left the Bay Area, Winterford was living an isolated existence in a cabin her mother owned in Colorado, and as the Chronicle reports, she "maintained regular, sometimes antagonistic contact with [Ziz] LaSota and other rationalists through online forums." That contact was often bullying, and in early March 2021, she took her own life, shortly after leaving a comment on Ziz's blog saying, "I have been trying to destroy my system for months out of a belief that it’s done more harm than good."



> Born Jacob Ray Pekarek in Fort Worth, TX, Jay grew up in Grapevine, TX, and Kingwood, TX. Jacob loved the outdoors and camping with all his friends and family from an early age, especially if his dogs Molly & PJ were there. Jacob had a beautiful smile, big blue eyes, and a delightfully infectious laugh. Jay was an honor student, an orchestra and academic letterman, and one of the Top Ten Students in the Class of 2011 at Kingwood Park High School.
> 
> Jay was one-of-a-kind, a unique character. In addition to loving philosophy and having a sharp mind, Jay sought meaning behind all things. Jay was smart, curious, clever, and liked sharing knowledge with others.
> 
> After starting as a philosophy major, Jay declared: “Stand Back -- I'm going to try Science!” and then earned a BS in 2015 from Trinity University, double majoring in Math and Chemistry. Jay was a member of the “Swashies" of Myrtle dorm, enjoying going out for pizza and Indian food, debating philosophy, hosting Haunted Halloween, playing Minecraft, and solving the world’s problems.
> 
> Jay enjoyed playing games -- especially when winning. Jay was fond of cooking, experimenting, and playing with animals. Jay would wear shorts in a blizzard, celebrate Pi Day, make incredible costumes, and laugh out loud at The Fantastic Mr. Fox.
> 
> Jay loved to have adventures and travel to see friends and family. There were lots of trips to Kerrville, Colorado Springs and Big Bend with Mimi, Papa & Mom. Jacob also spent many happy times in Westminster, Katy, Calgary, Spokane, and Nederland with Dad and Jeannie. This love of travel and adventure continued when Jay lived with friends on a sailboat in the Berkeley Marina, and, afterwards, in Zurich. Jay moved to Estes Park in 2018, where they often hiked in the park, camped, or just visited with good friends in Estes, Boulder, Longmont, and Denver.
> 
> The world has truly lost a gem.
> 
> Jay was preceded in death by loving grandparents, Ronald C. “Papa” Withers & Peggy J. “Mimi” Withers, and Richard L. “Grandpa” & Faye D. “Grandma” Pekarek.
