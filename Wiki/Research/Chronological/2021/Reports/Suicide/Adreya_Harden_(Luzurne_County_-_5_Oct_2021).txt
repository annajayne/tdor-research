suicide



> Adreya Harden was a 15 year old student at  Wyoming Valley School District and the West Side Career and Technical Center in Luzerne County. She was also a transgender teen who faced indescribable violence and bullying from her classmates, her school, and the community.
> 
> The school district and teachers refused to use her name, insisting on referring to her by her deadname. She was not permitted to enroll in a cosmetology program by school officials.  In response to this request, her school counselor told her she would “have a hard time fitting in” and enrolled her in the food marketing and distribution program. She missed so many days due to the bullying that the school charged her with truancy, a charge the judge dismissed based on the bullying.
> 
> During her sixth and seventh grade years, the school arranged for private tutoring after hours but withdrew that support during COVID-19.
> 
> On Oct. 5, 2021, Adreya died by suicide. And on October 5, 2023, her mother Sa’Raya Harden filed a federal lawsuit claiming the Wyoming Valley School District and the West Side Career and Technical Center did not do enough to curb the bullying and support Adreya, which contributed to her death. The lawsuit presented 12 counts revolving around discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clauses, violations under Title IX, deliberate indifference to the bullying, intentional infliction of emotional distress and gross negligence. 
> 
> From PennLive
> 
> Both the Wyoming Valley School District and the West Side Career and Technology Center have policies against bullying and harassment. The tech school obliges employees to report bullying and involve its Title IX Coordinator when harassment on the basis of sex occurs. However, the tech center did not follow its own policy, the lawsuit said.
> 
> The school district, meanwhile, did not have a Title IX policy in place and did not have a suicide prevention policy in place, according to the law firm.
> 
> The West Side Career and Technology Center’s policy prohibits “bullying” and “cyberbullying” but does not address bullying on the basis of sex, gender, sexual orientation or gender non-conformance.
> 
> The Wyoming Valley School District’s anti-harassment policies addressed harassment related to sex and sexual orientation, but never clearly extended that definition to harassment on the basis of gender or gender non-conformance.
> 
> It is important to consider the cultures surrounding these schools. The incessant anti-trans rhetoric spewed by the rightwing machine in the communities where the students live. In 2020, former President Trump wins Luzerne County by 15%, During the pandemic years under scrutiny, Pennsylvanians brutalized then Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine.
> 
> Adreya had support from her family. That’s a key protective factor for trans youth along with access to appropriate health care. But school is also important and that’s where we all failed this young woman.
> 
> Adreya deserved to go school free of violence and harassment. She certainly deserved to pick her own education trajectory if she met the qualifications applied equally to other students. She deserved to celebrate her birthdays and move into adult life without fearing for her life at school. Wyoming Valley School District and the West Side Career and Technical Center both failed her and should be held accountable so they can change. Kudos to her mother for bravely taking on this task.
> 
> As we head into the General Election in Pennsylvania, many school board seats are up for election and we should all be asking those candidates about LGBTQ competent policies, school safety, book bans, and more. If you are outraged that this child died in part because her school district did not value her welfare, you need to vote the bastards out who make or fail to make these policies. We have an obligation to Adreya Harden’s memory.
> 
> And a special level of shame on the Pennsylvania media outlets who deadnamed Adreya (using the name assigned at birth) in their coverage of this lawsuit. How much more obtuse and vicious could you be?
> 
> Rest in power, Adreya. You deserved so much, especially to be free of despair and abuse in your school. We must do better for other trans and nonbinary students, for all LGBTQ students. I hope your mother’s pursuit of justice in your name paves the way for a brighter future.

May your memory be a revolution.





> Mom sues Pa. school district on behalf of transgender teen who killed herself
> 15-year-old Adreya Harden was tired of the incessant bullying she faced at school after coming out as transgender three years prior.
> 
> Students called the Luzurne County teen slurs, and teachers insisted on calling her by her birth name, “Andrew,” which emboldened other students to continue harassing her, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court this week. Using a transgender person’s former name is called deadnaming and can be used to mock people or invalidate their gender identity.
> 
> Adreya and her family began the process in 2021 to have her name legally changed. But delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic kept pushing her hearing back.
> 
> Adreya killed herself Oct. 5, 2021—before the hearing could go through. And now, Adreya’s mother, Sa’raya Harden, is suing the Wyoming Valley School District and the West Side Career and Technical Center, saying they did not do enough to curb the bullying and support Adreya, which contributed to her death.
> 
> The lawsuit presented 12 counts revolving around discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clauses, violations under Title IX, deliberate indifference to the bullying, intentional infliction of emotional distress and gross negligence. The lawsuit says Adreya’s suicide could have been prevented had the district fulfilled its duties.
> 
> Adreya heard anti-gay and anti-trans slurs every day in classrooms and hallways, sometimes in the presence of school officials. Five teachers refused to call her by her chosen name during roll call, and students harassed her about her gender, asking about her genitalia and whether she was going to “chop that penis off.”
> 
> The teen came out as a member of the LGBTQ+ community when she was in sixth grade which prompted the bullying, the lawsuit said.
> 
> The school district did not address this bullying, and instead allowed Adreya to receive her education through private after-hours instruction by a teacher at a local library during her sixth and seventh grade years, the lawsuit said.
> 
> At the onset of the COVID pandemic, that option was not available, however. Adreya had to attend public school once more.
> 
> She asked her teachers to call her Adreya, or at the very least her last name, Harden, multiple times. However, the teachers refused and continued to call her “Andrew” in front of other classmates, which caused her to feel humiliated and depressed, the lawsuit said.
> 
> As the bullying got worse, Adreya began missing school in her eighth grade year. The school district brought her before District Judge James Hagerty on truancy charges, but the judge found the absences were legitimate and allowed her to enroll in ninth grade after he heard about the harassment and bullying at school, the lawsuit said.
> 
> Adreya never felt safe within the school, particularly at the West Side Career and Technology Center, where she wanted to study cosmetology her ninth grade year. Instead, her school counselor told her she would “have a hard time fitting in” and enrolled her in the food marketing and distribution program.
> 
> After Adreya died, the director of the cosmetology program said they were not informed she wanted to be part of the program but would have allowed her to enroll had they known.
> 
> When the Harden family submitted name-change paperwork to Tech asking they refer to the teen as “Adreya,” the teachers and employees refused to call her “Adreya” and instead continuously called her by her birth name, “Andrew,” in front of others.
> 
> One teacher at the tech school, Tom Pieczynski, emailed the school’s principal, Richard Rava, three times that Adreya was being bullied about her gender identity. However, Rava and the school never intervened, according to the lawsuit.
> 
> “Contrary to Rava’s obligation as a school official entrusted with the safety and education of all students, including vulnerable students like Adreya, Rava’s response was to ignore, dismiss, mock and sometimes blame Adreya for the abuse she was suffering,” the lawsuit said.
> 
> Eventually, Adreya begged her mother not to send her back to the tech school, before she killed herself by intentionally overdosing on her medication. Although she never left a note, she changed her Instagram status to “deceased” the night before.
> 
> Both the Wyoming Valley School District and the West Side Career and Technology Center have policies against bullying and harassment. The tech school obliges employees to report bullying and involve its Title IX Coordinator when harassment on the basis of sex occurs. However, the tech center did not follow its own policy, the lawsuit said.

> 
> Andreozzi & Foote, the law firm that filed the lawsuit, recently filed for early discovery to obtain the names of more district employees who may have had a hand in the situation.
> 
> PennLive could not reach an administrator at the Wyoming Valley School District, an administrator at the West Side Career and Technology Center, and Richard Raya to comment on the story
> 
> Adreya was a “striking young lady, who had an amazing spirit, and a bright light for the people that took the time to really get to know her,” her obituary read. She “thrived on building up her peers and emphasizing positivity and most importantly, to love yourself and Be Kind.”
