> While the deaths are not directly linked, all of the deceased were young transgender or gender-diverse people who had affirmed or were on a journey to affirm their identity as female, had a history of mental health issues and had at least one mental health diagnosis.
> 
> The lead case is Bridget Flack, a 28-year-old woman who died in 2020. She had begun gender affirmation in the years prior to her death and had a history of mental health issues.
> 
> “Bridget is described as ultimately expressing comfort and pride in being trans,” Gemma Cafarella, counsel assisting the coroner, told the court on Friday during a hearing laying out the scope of the inquiry.
> 
> Cafarella said Flack reported feeling isolated during Covid and could not participate in her hobbies which included activism, socialising and DJing. She had contact with public and private mental health service providers before her death, the court heard.
> 
> Flack was last seen by a friend on the morning of 30 November 2020 in Carlton. She had said she was going to take a walk in a park in Fairfield but, despite contacting people via phone later in the day, never returned home.

> After her disappearance made national headlines, more than 120 people, including members of the LGBTQ+ community, helped her family search for her body. Her body was found in bushland in Kew two weeks after she was reported missing. It is understood she died between 1 and 11 December, the court heard.
> 
> Flack’s body was found by members of the LGBTQ+ community, Carafella said.
> 
> “The commissioner for LGBTIQ+ communities has highlighted that the fact that Bridget was found by community members was highly distressing for the community,” she said.
> 
> The inquest will investigate if steps taken by Victoria police in regards to Flack’s case were consistent with their policies on searching for missing persons.
> 
> All five people who died were born between 1987 and 2001 and some were known to each other.
> 
> The court will also examine the deaths of Matt Byrne, a 25-year-old woman who died on 30 March 2021, Heather Pierard, a 20-year-old woman who died on 11 May 2021 and Natalie Wilson, a 33-year-old woman who died on 2 September 2020.
