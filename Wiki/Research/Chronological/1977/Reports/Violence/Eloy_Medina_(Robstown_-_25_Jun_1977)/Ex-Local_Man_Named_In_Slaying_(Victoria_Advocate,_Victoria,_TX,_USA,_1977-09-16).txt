===== Man Named In Slaying =====

Hilario Moreno, 22, of Robstown, a former Victoria resident, was named Thursday in a murder charge filed in Corpus Christi following investigation of the June 25 beating death of Eloy Medina, 27, of Corpus Christi, in a cotton field near Robstown.

Moreno is being held in the Nueces County Jail in Corpus Christi in lieu of a $50,000 bond.

Moreno, who listed a Victoria address in 1975, was arrested early Wednesday morning at a Robstown cotton gin where he is employed after information was supplied by Victoria officers, according to Capt, Ralph Perez, chief of detectives of the Nueces County Sheriff Department.

Perez said Medina's badly decomposed body was discovered July 7 in the cotton field off State Highway 44 west of Robstown. The Corpus Christi officers said a 20-inch bumper jack and a sawed-off hammer handle were the alleged murder weapons.
