===== Decomposed body found =====

A boy picking up aluminum beer cans northwest of Robstown yesterday evening discovered the badly decomposed body of an unidentified man in a drainage ditch between Highway 44 and Manor Road.

The Nueces County medical examiner was trying to identify the body this morning , but a spokesman said the body was probably that of a white male in his 20s who had been dead for two or three weeks.

The spokesman said the cause of death was still undetermined . The body had fractures to the head. The medical examiner's office expected to complete an autopsy this afternoon.

Investigators from Constable Johnny Calderon's office and the Nueces County Sheriff's Department this morning were examining the area in which the body was found and were not available for comment.

A spokesman for the C&M Ambulance service said the body was taken to the medical examiners's office about 9 p.m. yesterday. His body was clothed and lying just off a dirt road between Highway 44 and Manor Road, the spokesman said.
