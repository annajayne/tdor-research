===== Body is identified =====

The Nueces County Medical Examiner yesterday identified the badly-decomposed body discovered near Robstown last Thursday as a 28-year-old Corpus Christi man , who police say was a known female impersonator who had been arrested over 130 times.

Using fingerprints, the medical examiner identified the body as Eloy Medina, whose address was listed as 2707 Lamar Street. Medina had been dead for two or three weeks when a young boy discovered his body in a drainage ditch between Highway 44 and Manor Road northwest of Robstown.

The medical examiner was still trying to determine the exact of death; but a spokesman said man died from injuries to the left side of the body and head. Last week, the medical examiner said the type of injuries inflicted indicate he was murdered.

Medina was well known around the city police station. He had arrested approximately 135 times for charges ranging from drunk public to prostitution and homosexual conduct. The most serious charge filed against him was for assault with intent to commit murder in August, 1974.
