===== 1977 worst year in a decade for solving murders in St. Petersburg =====

Rickey Nelson, 20, a "known homosexual prostitute," was shot to death by an "acquaintance" as he and another man were sitting in a car behind the Cozy Corner Tavern, 1000 12th Ave. S. Nelson had been convicted of dressing as a woman and prostituting himself to men. 

Drolet said detectives have a suspect. But the man in the car with Nelson was also shot and blinded and cannot identify his assailant.
