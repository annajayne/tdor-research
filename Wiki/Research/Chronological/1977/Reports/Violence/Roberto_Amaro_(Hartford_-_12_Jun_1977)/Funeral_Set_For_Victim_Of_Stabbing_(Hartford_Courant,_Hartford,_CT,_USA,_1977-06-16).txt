Funeral Set For Victim Of Stabbing

The funeral of Roberto Amaro, 20, of 104 Edwards St., who was stabbed to death Sunday during what police said was apparently a dispute with a male acquaintance, will be Friday from the Caballero Funeral Home, Miami, Fla.

Amaro's roommate, Angel L. Espinosa, was charged with the death Monday.

Born in Miami, Amaro lived in Hartford seven months.

He leaves his father, Luis Amaro of Chicago; his mother, Mrs. Luisa Irgarry Amaro of Miami, and a brother, Luis Amaro Jr. of Miami.

Burial will be in Dade Memorial Park, Miami. There will be no calling hours. The James Funeral Home, 2016 Main St., has charge of local arrangements.
