===== Hartfordite Gets Term in Stabbing =====

HARTFORD (AP) — Angel Espinozo of Hartford was sentenced Wednesday to a prison term of seven to 14 years for fatally stabbing his roommate whose body was found in women's clothing last June.

Roberto Amaro's body was found in the street after he was stabbed in the chest with an eight-inch kitched knofe during an argument near their Hartford apartment, officials said.

Amaro was born in Miami, Fla., and lived in Hartford for seven months before the June 12 stabbing, officials said.

Superior Court Judge James Henebry sentenced Espinoza, 53.
