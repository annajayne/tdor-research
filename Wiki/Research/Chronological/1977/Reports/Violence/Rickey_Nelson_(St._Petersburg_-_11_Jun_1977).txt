At about 2 a.m. on 11 June, 1977, Rickey Nelson, 20, was shot and killed while sitting in a car in a parking lot behind the Cozy Corner Tavern, 1000 12th Ave. S., St. Petersburg, Florida, USA. James Paul Edwards, 50, was also shot and blinded in the attack. A third, unidentified, man shot both of them. 

The police, while having a suspect, were unable to get a firm id because Edwards had been blinded by the shooting and so could not identify him.

The police stated that Nelson was "well known" as  a "homosexual transvestite" and had convictions for wearing women's clothing and prostitution.
