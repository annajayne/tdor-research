===== Man Found Slain In Chester County =====

The body of an unidentified man who apparently had been shot and stabbed to death was discovered in a rural area of West Caln Township, Chester County, at about 1:30 p.m. Sunday.

State police at the Embreeville barracks said the body was discovered by two horseback riders. Police investigators said they believe the victim, who was in his middle 20s, might have been slain Saturday night and dumped along a rural road, located about five miles west of Coatesville.

Police were still investigating Sunday night, trying to determine the identity of the murder victim and a possible motive for the slaying.
