===== Coatesville Man Found Slain on Farm =====

The body of a 26-year-old Coatesville man, clad in a woman's blouse; with a bra pulled above his head, was discovered yesterday on an abandoned farm in West Cain Township, five miles southeast of Coatesville.

Two horseback riders found the body of Preston Alvin Frazier, of Coates Rd., while riding through the Old Savage Farm, off of Savage Road. The body had numerous gunshot and stab wounds. An autopsy showed that a gunshot of the neck proved to be the fatal wound. Frazier was last seen alive Thursday night in Coatesville.
