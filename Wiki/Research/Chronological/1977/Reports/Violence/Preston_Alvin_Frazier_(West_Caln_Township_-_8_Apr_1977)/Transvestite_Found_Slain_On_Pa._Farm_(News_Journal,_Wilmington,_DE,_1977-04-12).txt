===== Transvestite Found Slain On Pa. Farm =====
**By BOB LEARY**

COATESVILLE, Pa. — Some one wanted to make very sure the 26-year-old female impersonator was dead.

Seven bullets or pieces of bullets were found in the body and an attempt had been made to strangle Preston A. Frazier.

Then, Pennsylvania State Police believe, Frazier was dumped behind a pile of brush on an old abandoned farm just north of here. Two girls riding horses in the rural, western Chester County area discovered the body clad only in bra and blouse about 1:30 p.m. Sunday.

The man's hair, dyed red. had been plaited into ribbon held pigtails. The eyes were made up with eye shadow and mascara And the hand and toenails were painted.

Frazier was free pending trial on charges he stopped and robbed a motorist while wearing women's clothing last Dec. 5.

Pennsylvania State Police Sgt Joseph Monville said today there are no suspects in the "overkill" slaying, but sources close to the investigation say state police and county detectives have interrogated "some people."

Presumably, those interrogated would include some of Frazier's former friends in the in-between world in which he lived, friends who would gather with him late at night outside a run down hotel on E. Lincoln Ave. in Coatesville.

"He was a trouble-maker," one source said. "He'd been in lots of trouble around here."

Records at the Chester County Clerk of Courts office showed Frazier had prevously served time for a conviction for criminal attempt to rob, aggravated assault and four other related charges.

He was last seen alive late Thursday night in a station wagon outside the E. Lincoln Ave hotel, the source said. Another, unidentified person was with him in the vehicle, but the source was not certain whether the person was a man or a woman.

Although State Police and County detectives would not confirm the report, the source said tire tracks were found where the body was dumped and detectives should be able to establish the type of vehicle that made them.

A fingerprint expert from Harrisburg was reportedly brought in to try to lift prints from the victim's neck.

The source said all gunshot wounds were apparently inflicted by a small-caliber weapon.

The source said the slaying may have taken place as late as Saturday.

Frazier, who had no known place of employment, apparently lived with his parents in the 700 block of Coates St.

A woman employe at the hotel said "Preston was a regular customer at the bar" who wore women's clothes "all the time."

But, she said, "he never caused no trouble, never used foul lan gauge or anything like that. He was very good mannered."
