The body of Preston Alvin Frazier, 26, of Coatesville, PA, was found by two horseback riders, strangled, shot and stabbed "numerous times", and partially nude, about 1:30 pm on 10 Apr., 1977, on the Old Savage Farm, off Savage Road, in the West Caln Township northwest of Coatesville, PA.

A gunshot to the neck was determined to be the fatal injury by state police. They had last been seen 3 days earlier, on Thurs., 7 Apr., 1977.

Police thought it likely that they had been killed somewhere else between Thurs and Sunday and the body dumped. Police stated they had no suspects in the "overkill" slaying.
