===== The Story Behind the News =====

Regarding the article "The Torturous Journey From Hero to Transvestite" (March 25): I feel that your lead article on Harvey Aberle festooned on the front page was unfortunate and lacking in good taste. There is no reason whatsoever to make the memory of the deceased or his alleged aberrant sexual practices the object of sick curiousity or ridicule. At best there is suspicion of his behavioral preference not proof. Thus his family and girlfriend are the immediate victims of the embarrassment and the readers of your paper are the ultimate victims of this lamentable episode.

Is there not sufficient news worthy of more genuine interest meriting front-page treatment? There are countless persons engaged in the performance of good works which more justly warrant publication for the edification of and emulation by the public.

Regarding the article "The Torturous Journey From Hero to Transvestite”: I was pleased to see that Leonard Levitt pursued the circumstances surrounding that curious shooting of the transvestite in Lawrence recently. It is one of the most psychologically frightening stories in quite some time and further evidence that the recant rash of bizarre crimes by Vietnam veterans merits immediate attention.

Levitt’s background information is of great help in viewing a harmless sexual preference as it becomes a self-destructive force. It seems most ironic that Harvey Aberle’s "irrational attack" on the police waa almost a parody on the "heroic” act for which his country awarded him the Silver Star.

In any care the perversion most evident in Harvey Aberle’s story is not a sexual matter but rather the way in which society perverted Aberle himself.

While in a philosophical mood I was thinking about crime. I concluded that not all criminals are bad people; they suffer from mental illness. Perhaps if America’s penal system devised jails with intensive psychiatric care our criminal problem would be reduced.

The account of Harvey Aberle confirms my new realization. Stress and the inability to cope with problems produces deviant behavior in a multitude of forms. Congratulations to Leonard Levitt for his genuine, ultimately mature account of a troubled man. The article was very impressive for it went to the substance of a situation with a detailed analysis. Instead of trying to catch the readers’ interest with the gory dirty details of a news event, it explained it.
