===== Cops Who Killed Man In Fem Attire Fired In Self-Defense: Chief =====

**By ALICE MURRAY and ARTHUR MULMCAN**

Three Nassau County cops who fired 18 shots at a man dressed in women's clothing- after he allegedly threatened them with what proved to be an empty gun, "were shooting in defense of their lives," Chief of Detectives Frank Klecak said yesterday. Six of the shots hit the man.

The incident took place shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday on the grounds of the plush Lawrence (L.I ) Country Club golf course. The victim was identified as a Vietnam war hero, Harvey Aberle, 27, of 71-26 Parsons Blvd., Flushing, Queens.

Klecak said that an initial investigation of the shooting showed that the police officers "did not act irresponsibly." He said that they "did what they were supposed to do."

Klecak made the remarks at a press conference he called to reveal the preliminary results of the investigation. As chief of detectives, it is his responsibility to coordinate the probe, which is routine when cops shoot someone.

The county homicide squad and the district attoney's office are continuing their investigation into the shooting, in which Aberle, wearing a woman's wig, silk bikini underpants, a bra and a black-knit slip under a white robe, supposedly jumped out of a wooded area and pointed a gun at Officer Stephen Kunkel.

==== Was Investigating Empty Car ====

Kunkel, who had gone to investigate an empty station wagon parked on the golf course, radioed for help as Aberle ran off, police said.

Police Officers Robert Donohue and Michael Hertz arrived and the cops pursued Aberle onto a fairway. Police said Aberle repeatedly pointed his gun at them and at one point said, "I'll kill, you. I'll kill you."

The officers fired and three times Aberle fell, only to rise and point his gun at them, the officers insisted. The fourth time he fell, he was dead, they said.

Klecak said that the medical examiner's office will conduct further toxicological tests because of capsules, "some dissolved and some undissolved," which were found in Aberle's stomach. He said that Aberle also had some "old"' needle marks on his arm.

Police said they found other items of women's clothing in the station wagon as well as sex literature and sex paraphernalia.

Private funeral services were held for Aberle last night at the Riverside Church, 123d St. and Riverside Drive. Aberle, as an Army medic, was awarded the Silver Star for bravery soon after the 1968 Tet offensive in Vietnam. A year earlier, while in the military, he was arrested in Queens on a charge of possessing a knife.
