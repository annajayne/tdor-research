===== The Tortuous Journey From Hero to Transvestite =====

**By Leonard Levitt**

//At 10 o'clock on a foggy Saturday night two weeks ago a  23-year-old graduate student in psychology at a Long Island college drove to her boyfriends apartment in Flushing. When she arrived the drawers were all open, every light was on, and clothes were strewn a;l over the floor The boyfriend apparently had left just minutes before. He had made himself a drink and the ice had not yet melted in the glass. Then the girl walked into the bedroom. Her boyfriend had taken two of his favorite 8 by 10-inch color photos of her and propped them up against the wall. Next to them he had placed two movable lamps that shone down the photos like spotlights.//

//At about the same time she arrived at the apartment, a figure wearing women’s clothing, false eyelashes, and a woman's wig stepped out of the bushes at the Lawrence Golf Club. Holding a .38-cal revolver with both hands, the figure pointed it at Nassau County Police Officer Steven Kunkel and shouted "You pig son-of-a-bitch You’re dead." Kunkel said he heard the snap of the gun’s hammer. But no shot was fired. The figure then fled into the darkness, and Kunkel who was joined by three other officers pursued it.//

//Confronted by the four officers on a fairway the figure again pointed the gun at Kunkel, police said. Kunkel fired two shots and the figure fell. But still holding the gun, according to police , the figure "immediately got up" and "kept coming." In all, the police fired 18 bullets, five striking the figure. The fatal shot was a bullet in the heart.//

Harvey Aberle, a 27-year old Vietnam veteran who had won the Army’s third highest award for bravery, the Silver Star, stopped off after work two Saturdays ago to pick up his girlfriend at her parents’ home not for from the Lawrence Golf Course. The two went shopping at the nearby Farmer’s Bazaar on Rockaway Turnpike to get food for dinner, which they planned to eat at Aberle’s apartment in Queens. But while shopping, they got into an argument about which shopping cart to use. Aberle preferred one. The girl another. Abruptly Aberle dropped off his girlfried at her parents’ home and returned alone in his 1972 yellow Volkswagen stationwagon to his apartment at 71-26 Parsons Boulevard in Flushing.

An hour later, at about 7:30, the girlfriend, who had been seeing Aberle for the past two years, phoned his apartment. There was no answer, and at 10 PM she decided to drive there. When she arrived, the place was in chaos. In the bedroom she saw the two pictures of herself.

At 10:45 that night, Police Officer Steven Kunkel of the Nassau County Police Department spotted a 1972 yellow Volkswagen stationwagon parked about 90 feet off the Causeway which runs through the Golf Course. The area was familiar to Lawrence Aberle and his girlfriend. They had one made love there.

Near the car, Kunkel said he discovered two suitcases filled with women’s undergarments, pornographic magazines, and metal and leather "bondage" chains. On the ground were a tape recorder and cassette and women’s jewelry and mirrors. Then Kunkel said, he heard a noise in the bushes and observed two figures running. Moments later, Kunkel said, one of them— a figure in women's clothing wearing a long brown wig— stopped, stepped out of the bushes pointing a .38-cal revolver at nim and shouted, "You pig son-of-a-bitch You’re dead.” Kunkel said he heard the snap of the gun's hammer, but no shot was fired.

By then three other officers had arrived, and together with Kunkel, they pursued the figure across the golf course. As they ran police said the figure’s wig dropped to the ground.

Suddenly, police said, the figure again turned toward Kunkel and pointed the gun. Kunkel fired two shots. Police said the figure fell but, still holding the gun, got up and kept coming toward the officers. The police kept firing—18 shots in all—and the figure fell and got up once again before foiling the final time.

Approaching the body, police discovered that it was dressed in tan bikini underwear, a black half-slip tan half-slip and a wrap-around dress.  A .38-cal. re-

volver still clutched in one hand was unloaded. The body was that of Harvey Aberle.

For Aberle’s friends and relatives, the circumstances of his death have caused embarrassment and disbelief. More disturbing to them than the police acount of his shooting —the details of which will be routinely presented to a grand Jury Monday—is the account of his transvestism, a rare and little-known diseases that refers to someone—almost always a man—dressing in the clothes of the opposite sex.

Because of the stigma attached to transvestism, Aberle’s girlfriend—a PhD candidate in psychology— asked that her name not be used in this article. A doctor in cancer research at Long Island Jewish Hospital who regularly jogged with Aberle also refused to speak about him for the same reason. And the only relative—an aunt—who allowed her named to be used in a newspaper article about Aberle was fired from her job at an advertising agency because she did.

"Professional people and the public are desperately in need of more education about transvestism,” said Dr. John Money, a professor of Medical Psychology at Johns Hopkins University and one of the few recognized experts in the field of paraphilia, the preference for or addiction to unusual sexual practices, of which transvestism is one. According to Money there are no statistics to determine how common transvestism is because "transvestites do not recognize they have a problem until they are caught. They may suffer,” Money said "but they are not aware they are suffering.”

It is not known what causes transvestism, although Money said that society’s attitudes towards a child’s sexual behavior may be a crucial factor. Money said: "If a child grows up in a home with healthy sexual attitudes, this is the best guarantee there will be no paraphilia. People do the most atrocioous things to punish children for what should be normal sexual exploring." On the other hand, Money said, in certain cases, transvestite behavior in nonparaphiliacs can be brought on by tenshion from the outside, when, for example, someone is placed under unusual strain.

According to Money, transvestitites are not homosexuals. It is possible, Money said, for a transvestite to have a sexual relationship woth a woman, although in a continuing relationship, he said, sex will become a chore and a nuisance. In the classic case, Money said, "a man feels tension built up in him that becomes unbearable. He will find a resolution of this terrible tension in women's clothing. The relief of tension comes not from the clothes but from an orgasm. In the truely classic case, a man can't do this unless he dresses up."

Dr. Robert Stoller, in his psychology textbook "Perversion—The Erotic Form of Hatred", puts it another way. "In the pornographic literature [of] . . . transvestites there are repeated stories with the same theme— a frightened, pathetic, defenseless boy-man finds himself through no fault of his own trapped by a powerful, dangerously beautiful woman who bullies and mutilates him. The poor victim ['s] . . . peak of . . . victimization is illustrated by the woman physically forcing him to put on womens clothes . . . "

Just how these symptoms and definitions apply to Harvey Aberle are revealing in some areas, confusing in others. According to those who knew him, he was one of two children of a wealthy Jewish family in Teaneck, N. J. His mother described as "a dominating, beautiful woman, slim and elegant, to whom Harvey was inordinately attached. He was not close to his father a businessman.

Aberle described himself to his girlfriend as "resentful of my mother," rejected by her, and unable to please her. Two of his earliest recollections, he told her, were being forced by his mother to wear short pants to school, where he was laughed at by other children, and being punished by his mother for bad marks.

At 16, his parents divorced. Both remarried soon afterward. Aberle was placed in the custody of his mother, who had married to a wealthy realtor. Aberle, who had always had trouble in school, attended four private schools during three years of high school, leaving after the 11th grade without a diploma. He then enlisted in the Army, earning his high school equivalency diploma there. He became a medic and in 1968 was sent to Vietnam.

Besides the Silver Star, he won a Purple Heart, an Army commendation modal for valor and a combat medics badge. He won the Silver Star when, as a private first class, he participated in a successful rescue of three South Vietnamese soldiers. An account in the Army-Times of July 27, 1968, says Aberle "crossed a rice paddy through a hail of bullets . . . and carried a wounded soldier on his back under enemy fire."

On his return to Fort Dix in New Jersey, however, Aberle became addicted to heroin, his girlfriend said. Because of this, he was not granted an honorable discharge, but was discharged from the Army "under honorable conditions."

His father had moved to Cleveland and was working as a sporting goods buyer. Aberle moved there, then signed himself into a Veterans Administration hospital to cure his addiction. After 30 days in a locked-in ward, he released himself, his girlfriend said.

At Aberle's autopsy, the Nassau County medical examiner, Dr. Leslie Lukash, noted old needle marks near his elbows, apparently from his addiction. Friends said he had not used hard drugs since his release from the hospital, but the autopsy disclosed barbiturates and amphetamines in his stomach which had been taken just hours before he died.

Aberles father helped him get a job selling sporting equipment, and for the next three years, Aberle worked aa a sporting goods representative, traveling through Indiana and Ohio. For the first time in his life, he appeared to develop a relationship with his father. Three times a week, the two worked out together in a gym, and friends of his father introduced him to a 21-year-old wc woman who became his wife.

Early in 1974, Aberles father went to the Far East on a buying trip. While en route from Seoul to the airport, the taxi in which he was riding was struck by a bus and he was killed. After making arrangements for the funeral, Aberle and his wife left Cleveland and returned east. Within a year, they were divorced.

At first, Aberle took a job with a sporting goods firm in New York. But with business lagging at the height of the recession in late 1974, Aberle went to work for his stepfather, George Rothman of Butler, N J. He got his New Jesey real estate license and began to manage office and apartment buildings that Rothman owned. He also moved into one of his stepfathers luxury high-rise apartments in Fort Lee, NJ. In addition, he attempted to sell condominiums in upstate New York and waa working seven days a week.

It was during this time that he met the young woman who lived near the Lawrence Golf Club. Tall, muscular and good-looking, he also continued to see other women. One of them was a prostitute. It was from her, the girlfriend believes, that he purchased the revolver that was found on him when he died.

His relationship with the young woman in Lawrence endured. She moved into his and he became to her family. "He used to stop off from work and sit in the kitchen and just talk to me, the womans mother said.

"He saw love in this house that he never had in his own home, the womans father said.

"He was normal in every way, the girlfriend said. "Sexually he was dynamite."

Last August, however, he was summarily fired by his stepfather, and told he was "unqualified."  Commissions he felt were due him were never paid. Aberle then held back his rent, and around Thanksgiving, his stepfather had him evicted.

"Thats when I noticed the change in him, the girlfriend said.

After six weeks on unemployment, he got a job as a stock clerk at the Great Bear auto repair shop in Far Rockaway. "He was a real hard worker," said his supervisor, who asked that his name not be used. "He worked six days a week and if we got stuck here, he'd stay late. Sometimes he'd use his own car to pick up things for us — after hours. Once he had an accident to his car and I laid out money for him to get it repaired. As soon as payday came, he paid me. the cops came here, I told them I didnt believe it. It was that simple."

But in the last two or three months, the girlfriend said, "he was very depressed, very discouraged. He felt he couldnt make me happy, no matter what he did to satisfy me, it wasnt enough materially, psychologically, sexually."

It was in these last three months that Aberles girlfriend noticed indications that Aberle may have been dressing in women's clothing. "It was a secret thing and he must have been so ashamed," a relative said. "He himself didnt know what he was dealing with. When he saw himself doing those things, he thought his was a homosexual.

"He saw himself trying on [his girlfriends] clothes. Wearing a lampshade as a hat Perhaps he thought it was funny at the beginning. But soon it wasnt funny at all

"If we had only known, the relative continued, "we could have gotten him some help. He suffered so much, and we didnt even know. 

"I said to the girlfriend, 'Why didnt you tell us? She said, 'He never would have forgiven me.'"

The girlfriend said: "I think when the cops caught him, when they saw him like that, he wanted to die. Maybe that's why he kept getting up and holding the gun. He thought he was being a man."
