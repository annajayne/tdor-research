In a likely case of "suicide-by-cop", Harvey Aberle, 27, was shot-and-killed by three police officers with the Nassau County police on 12 Mar., 1977, after repeatedly pointing an unloaded gun at the police and saying "I'll kill you, I'll kill you" on the grounds of the Lawrence Country Club golf course, in Lawrence, New York, USA.

Aberle, a former Army medic who had been awarded the Silver Star for bravery in Vietnam, was dressed as a woman at the time of their death.
