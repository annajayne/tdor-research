===== Man guilty in slaying, kidnaping =====

John Wesley Call, 37, was found guilty of murder and kidnaping yesterday by a jury in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court.

Call, 7147 Westfall Drive, Butler Twp., was found guilty of the shooting death of Henry Brown Jr., 25, of 3220 Home Ave., on March 18.

He was also found guilty of kidnaping a woman at gunpoint about two hours after the murder. The woman was kidnaped about 3 a.m. at a North Dixie Market.

Call was arrested a few minutes after the kidnaping on Wagner Ford Road after his car wrecked on Rip Rap Road while trying to elude police cruisers from three police agencies, Montgomery County Sheriff deputies said. The woman was not hurt in the incident.

Visiting Judge Donald Ziegel sentenced Call seven to 25 year imprisonment on the kidnapping offense and 15 years to life imprisonment on the murder offense.

The trial began Monday with Walter Dodsworth and James Levinson as the prosecutors and William Clinard as Call's defense attorney.
