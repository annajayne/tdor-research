===== Top Police Work Put Killer Away =====

**By JONATHAN MILLER, Daily News Staff Writer**

When Dayton police were called to the scene of a murder on the West Side at 1 a.m. last Mar. 16 it looked as if they had a tough case to solve.

Sprawled on the sidewalk at the corner of N. Summit and Edison Sts. was the body of Henry Brown Jr., 25, of 3220 Home Ave. Brown died of a .25 caliber gunshot wound in his back.

**POLICE KNEW** Brown as a female impersonator. Beat patrolmen on the West side kept an eye out for him.

There was just one witness, a Dayton man who heard a shot, then saw Brown staggering away from a car.

The witness, Mark A. Hampton, told police he say the car speed up and drive away. It was a 1966 Ford sedan and it was driven by a white male, Hampton said.

Nevertheless, over the next few hours, police solved the Henry Brown murder.

Here's how they did it:

About a half hour after Brown's death, a 37-year-old man with longish hair and a mustache walked into the Stop and Go market at 8709 N. DIxie Dr. in Butler Twp., and swearing loudly, demanded to be sold beer.

**THE NIGHT** check-out clerk, Connie West, 26, told the man to stop swearing and leave the store. He did.

Ninety minutes later he was back. This time he held a small silver automatic, and he ordered Miss West into his car. It was a dark colored 1966 Ford.

With the man guzzling beer from a can, she was driven off in th the night.

At 2:50 a.m. that morning a Butler Twp. policeman, Thomas Humbert, was on routine patrol on N. Dixie Dr. He became suspicious of the auto and followed it at a distance to the Stop and Go market.

Humbert parked his cruiser at a gas station across the road from thhe market, and watched as a man and a woman left the store and got into the car. As the Ford drove off, he noted its license number on his log sheet — 7795 RT.

The policeman found the market deserted. He unclipped a portable radio phone from his belt, and just seconds after the abduction, every policeman in the county was on the lookout for the suspect's car.

**THE BUTLER TWP.** radio broadcast was picked up at the Dayton Safety building where homicide squat Stg. Jack Ray was scratching his head over Dayton's latest killing.

As soon as he heard the description of the car, and found it registered to John Wesly Call, 37, of 7147 Westfall Dr., he recognized the connection.

For, like Brown, Call was well known to police.

Call has over 40 arrests on his record. He has been convicted three times in local courts of felony charges, including carrying a concealed weapon.

**IN 1972**, he had been shot, he said, by a black prositute. And he had told investigating officers at the time he was going to get revenge.

In Call's car, meanwhile, Miss West was going through the most frightening experience of her life.

Assistant Montgomery County Prosecutor James Levinson credits what happened next as saving Miss West from sexual abuse and possibly worse.

A Vandalia patrolman, alerted for the Call auto, postted the car and gave chase. Call took off at high speed and tried to elude the cruiser. He failed.

Call's car left the road and got mired in a field. Bleeding from the mouth from the impact of the sudden stop, Cal made a break for it, tossing his gun into a barnyard several hundred yards away.

**MISS WEST** crawled out of the car, hysterical from her ordeal.

An off-duty sheriff's officer, Joe Sabolcik, a Box 21 volunteer with a police band rado in his car, picked up Call walking by the side of Wagoner Ford Rd. two hours later.

A .25 caliber shell casing was found among empty beer cans on the back floor of Call's automobile. Fingerprint experts checked out the gun, and found Call's right index finger's print on the ammunition clip.

A ballistics examiner test fired the weapn and compared the spent bullet to the one that had killed Brown. They proved identical.
