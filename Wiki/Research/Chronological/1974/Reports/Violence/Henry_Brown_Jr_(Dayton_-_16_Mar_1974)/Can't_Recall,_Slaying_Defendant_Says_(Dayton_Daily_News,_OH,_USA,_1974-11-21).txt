===== Can't Recall, Slaying Defendant Says =====

John Wesley Call testified in his own defence Wednesday in his trial for kidnaping and murder. He said he couldn't remember what had happened when he is alleged to have shot a Dayton man to death and abducted a female grocery clerk.

Call, 37, of 7147 Westfall Dr., told a jury in Montgomery county Common Pleas court that he had never owned a gun and had been arrested and convicted twice for felony offenses.

On cross-examination, assistant Montgomery county prosecuting attorney Walter L. Dodsworth suggested Call was lying. He introduced records of three felony convictions, including one for carrying a concealed weapon.

CALL'S LAWYER, William Clinard, also introduced alibi testimony from Call's brother and his former sister-in-law.

Neither could say for sure that call was with them at the time he is alleged to have shot to death female impersonator Henry Brown Jr., 25, of 3220 Home Ave.

The killing occurred in the early Mar. 16 at the intersection of N. Summit and Edison Sts. in West Dayton. Call is accused of kidnaping the grocery clerk several hours later. She was freed unharmed.
