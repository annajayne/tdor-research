===== John Call Looks Like Abductor, Victim Says =====

A 26-year-old former clerk at a North Dixie Dr. market testified Tuesday that John Wesley Call, 37, of 7147 West-fall Dr., looked like the man who abducted her at gunpoint last Mar. 16.

Call is charged with her kidnaping and a murder which occurred earlier in the evening at the corner of Summit and Edison Sts. in Dayton.

The woman broke into tears as she described her ordeal, which ended when sheriff's deputies forced Call's automobile into a field off Rip Rap Rd. in Butler Twp. after a chase.

**SHE SAID** Call had changed since she saw him on the night of the abduction, but she thought he was the same man who told her he had killed a man that night.

Call's attorney, William Clinard, failed in a move to suppress as evidence a .25 caliber shell casing discovered in Call's car after his capture.

Sheriff's deputy Michael Miller told the court his police dog had discovered a .25 caliber automatic pistol apparently abandoned by Call as police closed in on him.

**EVIDENCE** is slated to be introduced to show the gun was the same gun that killed Henry Brown Jr., 25, of 3220 Home Ave.

Brown was wearing women's clothing at the time of his death.

A plea of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity has been entered in the case.
