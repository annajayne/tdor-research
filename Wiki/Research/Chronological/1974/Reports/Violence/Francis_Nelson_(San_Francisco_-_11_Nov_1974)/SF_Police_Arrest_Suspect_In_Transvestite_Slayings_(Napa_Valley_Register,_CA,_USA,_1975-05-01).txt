===== SF Police Arrest Suspect In Transvestite Slayings =====

SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) — Police have made an arrest in their search for a knife wielding killer who attacked transvestites in their rooms.

Homicide Lt Charles Ellis said Wednesday Rushee Onez, 32, was taken into custody and charged with the slayings of Roger Carey, 42, found stabbed to death last Friday, and Francis Nelson, 75, slain on Nov. 11.

The officer said they were seeking another suspect.

Kills said his inspectors have been searching for months for the killer.

Posters warning "Drag Means Death" have been appearing for several months in areas frequented by transvestites. They are accompanied by gory photos of the victims.

The San Francisco Tavern Guild, an association of gay bar operators, and the Helping Hands Center posted a $550 reward for information leading to the killer of transvestites Donald Vasquez and Joseph Rodriquiz.

Police said they have discovered at least one other slaying that fits the pattern of the homosexual slayings.

The guild in its posters urged witnesses "to bring to justice the savage killers ... Do not remain silent ... You may be the next victim of these animals."
