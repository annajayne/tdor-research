===== Victim Of Killing Found In Apartment =====

A man dressed in woman's clothing was found fatally stabbed in the chest in an apartment at 3601 Shenandoah Avenue about 5:50 a.m. today, police reported.

The man, whose body was discovered by a friend, was identified as Marshall Miller, 28 years old. Miller had moved into the apartment Monday.

Officers said Miller had telephoned police around midnight from a nearby home to report that a woman was kicking on his front door. When he returned home, he discovered that a combination radio and phonograph had been taken, according to police.
