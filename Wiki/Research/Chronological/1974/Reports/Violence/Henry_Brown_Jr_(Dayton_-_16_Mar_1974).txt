At 1 a.m. on the morning of 16 March, 1974, Henry Brown Jr., 25, well known to local police as a 'female impersonator', was shot in the back at the corner of N. Summit and Edison Streets in Dayton, Ohio, by John Wesley Call, 37. 

Call was arrested a few hours later after kidnapping Connie West, 26, a Stop and Go check-out clerk. Police were able to connect him to the killing by fingerprints on the gun and ballistics analysis of the bullet that killed Brown.

Call was convicted in Nov. 1974 of kidnapping and murder. He was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for the murder and 7 to 25 years for the kidnapping.
