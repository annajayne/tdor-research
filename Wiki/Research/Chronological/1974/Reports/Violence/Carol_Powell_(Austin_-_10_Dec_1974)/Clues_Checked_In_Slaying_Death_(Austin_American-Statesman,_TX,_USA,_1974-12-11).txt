===== Clues Checked In Slaying Death Of Impersonator =====

Two vehicle descriptions and names of persons associated closely with a female impersonator who was slain early Tuesday may lead deputies to a suspect, the sheriff's chief investigator said Wednesday.

Jim Collier said the information was not conclusive enough yet to file charges in connection with the death of 25-year-old Harold Fredrick Powell of 1145 Mercer, Apt. 110.

But Collier said deputies intended to follow up the leads. "We have the description of a vehicle Powell was seen getting into Monday night," said Collier. "We also have the description of another vehicle belonging to a man who allegedly threatened to kill one other female impersonator several days ago."

Powell, who used the "street name" of Carol, according to Collier, was found shot to death about 7:45 a.m. Tuesday in the driveway of Mrs. Ruth Anderson, 701 Dalton Lane. He had been shot twice through the heck and head.

The dead man was dressed in a maroon sweater, blue jeans and a fur-trimmed black jacket. His hair appeared to have been bleached blonde.

Justice of the Peace Jim McMurtry, who ruled homicide in the death, said he felt certain Powell was shot at the location where the body was found. Powell was last sesn alive at a bar on E. 12th Street about 10:30 p.m. Monday, Collier said.

No identification papers were found on his body but ofificers learned Powell's name through finger prints and mug shots on file at the Austin Police Department, Collier said.

Collier speculated that the slaying was related to Powell's impersonation proclivities. He said the man had not been employed.
