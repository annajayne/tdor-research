Transgender woman Carol Powell, 25, was discovered shot in the neck and head about 7:45 A.M. of the morning of 10 December 1974 near a driveway at 710 Dalton Ave, Austin, Texas.

Police never identified or arrested a suspect in the case. Jim Collier, chief investigator in the case,  speculated that the slaying "was related to Powell's impersonation proclivities."

Other members of the trans community said that the police had mishandled the case and that they had heard police state that "it was just one more queen they didn't have to mess with."
