On 5 Dec., 1974, Tammi White, 30, died when Hal J. Ellison, 58, performed a silicone injection as the head of a nationwide silicone injection racket. Ellison injected industrial grade silicone directly into one of White's chest veins in Ellison's apartment at 4250 N. Marine Drive, Chicago.

White went into convulsions within minutes of the injection and died in Ellison's apartment. A later autopsy determined that silicone could be found throughout her body.

Injections of silicone to increase breast size had been banned by the FDA in 1971 following multiple cases of disfigurement and death from its use.

Ellison was convicted of practicing medicine without a license, concealment of a homicidal death, and of involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced to 1 to 3 years in prison.
