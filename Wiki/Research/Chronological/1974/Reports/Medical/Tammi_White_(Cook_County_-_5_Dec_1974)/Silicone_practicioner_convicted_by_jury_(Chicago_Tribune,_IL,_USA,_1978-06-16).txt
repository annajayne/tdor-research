===== Silicone practitioner convicted by jury =====
**By John O'Brien**

A CHICAGOAN ACCUSED of heading a nationwide silicone-injection racket will be sentenced July 17 for practicing medicine without a state license.

Hal Ellison, 62, who is free on bond, was convicted on that charge Wednesday night by a Criminal Court jury. Prosecutors had charged that Ellison, who is not a doctor, was practicing medicine when he made silicone Injections into a man's face in 1975.

Jim Lavine and Frank DeBoml, assistant state's attorneys, said Thursday that they plan to bring Ellison to trial later on charges of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the s
silicone-induced death of another man in 1974.

THE OFFENSE OF practicing medicine without a license is a misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of a year in jail. In its verdict, the jury acquitted Ellison of a felony charge, that of aggravated battery in connection with the 1975 silicone injections.

Prosecutors had contended that making such an injection is tantamount to a physical attack on another person. During the trial, Michael Martinez, 26, testified that he suffered facial injuries as a result of silicone injections he received from Ellison in 1975 to make his face appear less angular.

THE MANSLAUGHTER charge pending against Ellison stems from the death of Thomas White, 30, in Ellison's home, then a Marine Drive apartment, on Dec. 5, 1974. An autopsy found silicone throughout White's body.

Prosecutors contend that White died as a result of silicone entering his lungs. The Tribune disclosed several years ago that a nationwide ring was making illegal injections of liquid silicone into breasts and other body parts to enlarge them.
