===== Bribe of state officials in silicone case probed =====
**By Ronald Kotulak and George Bliss**

**REPORTS OF a bribe paid U state officials** to cover up an illegal silicone injection racket are being investigated by the Cook County State's Attorney's office, The Tribune learned Friday.

A $2,500 bribe reportedly was given to two investigators for the Illinois Department of Registration and Education in 1972, when the department said it received evidence that Hal J. Ellison was giving illegal liquid silicone injections.

Ellison, 59, of 4250 N. Marine Dr., was indicted Thursday by a Cook County Grand Jury on charges of aggravated battery and practicing medicine without a license.

**THE TWO Investigators were called** before the grand jury, but both reportedly took the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify.

Department files contained a letter charging Ellison with operating the silicone racket, but the case was marked closed with no report of an investigation.

A 10-month investigation by the state's attorney's office and The Tribune showed that Ellison charged between $50 and $200 an injection to build up a person's breast, hips, or face.

Since the case has been in the news the state's attorney's office has received a number of calls from persons who far they too were injected by Ellison, an investigator said. All information is treated confidentally, he added.

Two women questioned earlier said they needed breast removal surgery as a result of serious complications from the injections, he said. Both were housewifes seeking to enlarge their breasts, he said.

The federal Food and Drug Administration banned the use of liquid silicone to enlarge breasts after such injections were linked to a number of deaths and to frequent serious complications.

**COOK COUNTY State Atty. Bernard** Carey urged anyone who has received silicone injections to consult a physician to determine if medical care is needed.

Prosecutors said they would examine the body of Thomas White, 30, a female impersonator who died Dec. 5, 1974. in Ellison's apartment.

A Du Page Circuit Court judge Thursday granted permission to exhume the body for a new autopsy to determine if liquid silicone played a role in his death.
