Ellison gets up to 3 years in jail for silicone death
By Mike Tackett

A NORTH SIDE MAN accused of heading a nationwide silicone injection racket was sentenced to up to three years in prison Friday for involuntary manslaughter.

Hal J. Ellison, 63, of 4250 N. Marine Dr., was found guilty by a jury last month in the death of Thomas White, 30, on Dec. 5, 1974. White, also known as Tammie White, died after Ellison injected silicone into his chest.

Judge Thomas P. Cawley rejected pleas by Ellison's attorney, Sherman Magidson, to put his client on a work-release program instead of sending him to prison.

During the trial, prosecution witnesses testified that White, who was planning a sex-change operation, was injected with silicone from a dirty syringe and died within minutes after the silicone accidently entered the blood stream.

ONE WITNESS, April Vaujine, 35, a transsexual and a professional entertainer, testified that she was present the day White entered Ellison's apartment, stripped and lay on a couch before Ellison injected anesthetics and silicone into White's chest.

After the injection, she testified, White went into convulsions and began drooling. "Mr. Ellison said, 'Something has gone wrong,' " Vaujine testified.

Magidson reminded the jury during closing arguments that White had undergone silicone injections in New York and elsewhere before meeting Ellison. Magidson also referred to testimony suggesting White was a heavy druguser and in poor health.

MAGIDSON ASSERTED that White began partying two days before the in-jectoin, during which time the victim had taken at least eight Darvon tablets and shot into his veins an unknown quantity of Preludin, and another substance, apparently heroin.

Last summer, Ellison was found guilty of practicing medicine without a license. The jury last month also found him guilty of concealment of a homicidal death. Several other charges involving the silicone racket were dropped last summer after witnesses became reluctant to testify.
