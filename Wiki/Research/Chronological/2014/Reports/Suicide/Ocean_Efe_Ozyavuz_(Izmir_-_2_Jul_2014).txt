>  CHANGE TO BE YOURSELF
> In the explanation, the following explains why the Ocean died: "Close your eyes and imagine ... In the morning, imagine you wake up with a body that does not fit the gender you feel you belong to. People who look at that skin and treat you accordingly. Imagine that you are drowned with eyes, words, harassment advices! Imagine that nobody really sees who you are, do not understand ... Imagine that everybody pushed you from that skin not fit you, stupidly, you are buried in yourself forever! Choose between taking on the world. Change against everything and be subjected to 'abnormal' plugging and become yourself ... Still imagine enduring not to be considered 'normal' in your life ... "

The state's police, teacher, doctor, law, regulation. the fact that we have a share in the realization of all kinds of discrimination that we have experienced through the establishment of our country, the prevention of access to our basic rights such as shelter, education and employment, often only because of our gender identity, are just a few of the reasons that form the basis of these murders and suicides. 'normal!'"

In İpek's article on kaosGL.com, the following was stated: "We met with the ocean the day he hung himself. There were redness in the upper left part of his head and three cuts on the left side of his thumb." Will you tell me what happened? " I said, "I'll tell you." Yesterday my father, my mother, my brother started to come over me after I took me by car from you, they came over me a lot. Then we went to my aunts there and started to come over me all the family. None of them love me. He said, "Let's get rid of it now." asked. I said 'I can't come'. Then we talked for no more than 10 minutes. 'I'm going home,' he said, 'okay' I said. He didn't even hug him properly. I said, 'You can't go without proper wrapping.' I hugged, he hugged the same. I kissed. Gone ... Notice that so much pressure on LGBT individuals is driving them to suicide! When he died, he had two papers on the slide that I would prepare for him in his pocket. "They took the phone, but if they killed it, I wouldn't give it," he said in the morning. Unfortunately I cannot even go to the funeral of the person I love. " Notice that LGBT individuals are putting so much pressure on suicide! When he died, he had two papers on the slide that I would prepare for him in his pocket.
