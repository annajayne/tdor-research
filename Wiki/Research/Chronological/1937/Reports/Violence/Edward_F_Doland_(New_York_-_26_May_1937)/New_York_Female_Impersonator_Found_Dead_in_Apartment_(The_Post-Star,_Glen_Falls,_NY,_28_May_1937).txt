===== NEW YORK FEMALE IMPERSONATOR FOUND DEAD IN APARTMENT =====

NEW YORK, May 27, (AP)—His lifeless eyes staring and his bare legs tied with a bed sheet, a 57-year-old female impersonator was found today strangled to death in his disordered Lower East Side apartment, victim of Manhattan's latest bizarre homicide.

The dead man, Edward F. Dolan, lay clad only in a polo shirt with his head badly battered and a bent metal water pitcher lying nearby when the janitor entered the room after another lodger reported hearing a struggle.

The scene of the crime was an unusual Ludlow Street (38) apartment building known as "The House of All Nations'' because of the cosmopolitan character of its clientele.

Dolan, former night club entertainer temporarily employed by an optical firm, had lived there four years.

His roomate, Kenneth Reese, 37-continue year-old red haired flashily dressed hospital orderly, was absolved by police of any connection with the slaying after extensive questioning.

He said he went to work at the hospital at 7 last night and didn't get home until 7 this morning.

Neighbors said Dolan, who had appeared in Baltimore, Md., night clubs before coming here, was amiable but eccentric.

He often left his room, they said, dressed as a woman, explaining that he had impersonation engagements and preferred to dress at home.
