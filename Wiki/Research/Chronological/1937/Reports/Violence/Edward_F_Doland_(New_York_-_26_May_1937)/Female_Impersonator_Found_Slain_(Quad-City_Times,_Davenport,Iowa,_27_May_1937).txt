===== Female Impersonator Found Slain =====

New York, May 27—(AP)—Edward F. Dolan, 57-year-old dancer and female impersonator, was found beaten or strangled to death in his apartment in the "House of All Nations" Thursday. 

Dr. Milton Helpern, assistant medical examiner, said the actor's throat was discolored and swollen and his head badly battered and that death might have resulted from either cause.

Boris Pachscowich, who lived directly below Dolan, told Building Superintendent Joseph Migliori that he heard fighting and furniture banging late Wednesday night in Dolan's apartment. Kenneth Reese, 27, a hospital orderly who shared Dolan's apartment, said he worked Wednesday night am upon returning home found that a suitcase and some clothing were missing.

The "House of All Nations" got its name years ago because its residents in the main represented so many nationalities.
