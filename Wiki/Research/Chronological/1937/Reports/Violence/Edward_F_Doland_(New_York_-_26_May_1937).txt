The battered and strangled body of Edward F Doland, 57, a female impersonator who often left home dressed as a woman, was found in his apartment at 38 Ludlow St, New York, the morning of 27 May, 1937 by a building janitor who had been called by a neighbor who reported hearing the sounds of violence coming from the apartment the previous night.

The medical examiner said the body's throat was discolored and swollen and head badly battered and that death might have resulted from either cause.
