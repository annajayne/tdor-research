===== Circus Impersonator Was Former VA Clerk =====

NEBRASKA CITY, Neb., (UP)—Jack Lopez, circus female impersonator found dead in a boxcar here last week, was identified today as Jesse Charles Dillard, 27, one-time clerk typist at the veterans administration hospital at Nashville, Tenn.

Sheriff Carl Ryder said the federal bureau of identification at Washington notified him that the fingerprints were identical with those of Dillard who worked for the hospital in June, 1948. 

The FBI reported Dillard was born July 2, 1922, at Chestnut Mound, Tenn. No next of kin was shown on FBI or hospital records. The circus performer was buried here Thursday in a pauper's grave after no one claimed the body.
