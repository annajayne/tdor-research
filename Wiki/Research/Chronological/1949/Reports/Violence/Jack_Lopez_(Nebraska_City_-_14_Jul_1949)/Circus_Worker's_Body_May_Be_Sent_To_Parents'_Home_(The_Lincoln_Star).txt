===== Circus Worker's Body May Be Sent To Parents' Home =====

NEBRASKA CITY, Neb.—(AP)—Relatives of Jesse Dillard, slain circus performer who used the professional name of Jack Lopez, may want his body shipped to Tennessee, County Attorney Otto Wellensiek said here.

Wellensiek said District Attorney Baxter Key of Carthage, Tenn., and Lena Henderson of Carthage, cousin of the slain man, have asked for details on disposition of his body. Dillard's parents, Mr. and Mrs. James Robert Dillard, live near Chesnut Mound, Tenn.

Dillard was found slain in a boxcar here a short distance from the grounds where the Rogers Brothers circus played last July 14. He was buried in a pauper's grave here when no relatives could be located.

George O. Wells of St. Joseph, Mo., has been charged with first degree murder in the slaying and hearing in County court is scheduled for July 30. Wells pleaded innocent on his arraignment. The preliminary hearing originally was scheduled for July 28.
