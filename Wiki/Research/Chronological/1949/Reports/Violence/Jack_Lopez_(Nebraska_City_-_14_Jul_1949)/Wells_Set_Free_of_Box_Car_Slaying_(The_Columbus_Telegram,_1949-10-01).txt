===== Wells Set Free of Box Car Slaying =====

NEBRASKA CITY, Oct. 1 (UP)— George O. Wells, jr., 26-year-old riverboat worker from St. Joseph, Mo., was a free man today after jury acquitted him in the box car slaying of circus-performer Charles Jesse Dillard here July 4.

A jury of nine men and three women returned the verdict on the first ballot, after only 35 minutes of deliberation yesterday afternoon.

Wells, outwardly calm as the verdict was read, jubilantly shook the hand of each juror after the foreman finished reading the acquittal. His wife broke the tense silence in the courtroom when she burst into tears at hearing the words, "Not guilty."

The quick-moving trial opened Tuesday morning and swept swiftly to its climax.

==== Acted in Self Defense ====

The prosecution opened with an indication that it would attempt to prove robbery the motive in Dillard's slaying. It contended that Wells was "broke" at the time of the killing.

Defensive witnesses, however, testified that the riverboat worker had been paid $96 the day Dillard's body was found. And a fellow deckhand testified he had loaned him $2 the night before.

Wells himself was the last defense witness. The purple-heart paratrooper veteran of World War II testified that he had "struck a man" in the box car July 14, but that he did not know who he was hitting and did not intend to kill anyone.

The defendant said he had acted in self defense, to prevent the man from making immoral advances.

District Judge Thomas E. Dunbar instructed the jury yesterday to consider only a manslaughter charge. He dismissed possibility of first and second degree murder. He refused, however, the defense motion to dismiss the case.
