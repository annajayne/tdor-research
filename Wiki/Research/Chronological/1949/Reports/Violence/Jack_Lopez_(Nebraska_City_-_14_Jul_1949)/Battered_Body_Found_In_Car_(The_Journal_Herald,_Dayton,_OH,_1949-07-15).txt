===== Battered Body Found In Car =====

YORK. Neb., July 14.—(UP)—The battered body of a man with painted toe and finger nails, found in a box car at Nebraska City, was tentatively identified today as that of a circus female impersonator.

Jack Lopez, 32 or 33, was reported missing from Rogers Brothers circus when the troupe arrived here from Nebraska City, several hours after the body was found by a grain company employe in a railroad car.

The description of Lopez given authorities by Si Rubens, manager of the circus, fitted that of the body.

Dr. T. L. Weeks, who examined the body at Nebraska City, said the man was dressed in a silk cowboy shift and blue jeans. His finger and toe nails were painted a bright red. The hair on his head was long and the hair on his arms, legs, chest and abdomen here from Nebraska City several' was shaved, Weeks said.
