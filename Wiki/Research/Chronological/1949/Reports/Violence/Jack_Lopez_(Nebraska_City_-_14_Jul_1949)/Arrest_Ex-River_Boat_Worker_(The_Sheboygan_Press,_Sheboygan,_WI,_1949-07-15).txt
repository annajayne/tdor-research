===== Arrest Ex-River Boat Worker For Part In Box Car Slaying =====

Nebraska City, Neb.—(UP)—A former river boat worker was arrested today at St. Joseph, Mo., where he admitted he was involved in the box car slaying of a sideshow female impersonator, Otoe County Sheriff Cary Ryder said today. 

George O. Wells, about 30 or 35, admitted he fought with Jack Lopez in a box car several hours before the brutally beaten body of the Rogers Brothers circus performer was found here yesterday, Ryder said.

Wells was arrested at his St. Joseph home on a pickup order, Ryder said, after Wells was seen with the victim the day of the killing.

Wells, employed on a government boat, had been discharged that day, Ryder said.

Wells has waived extradition and Otoe county authorities were en route to St. Joseph, the sheriff said.

Although the victim's show name was Jack Lopez, his real name was believed to be Jack Blais, Ryder said.

Si Rubens, manager of the circus, said the performer was the son of a "well-known" Nashville physician, but no family of that name could be located there.
