===== Victim Identified As Circus Employee =====

Si Rubens manager of the Roger Brothers Circus which is scheduled to play in Hastings Friday said in York this afternoon that one of the circus employes was missing.

He said Jack Lopez, 32 or 33, who joined the show a week ago failed to show up when the circus left Nebraska City for York Wednesday night. Lopez was scheduled to drive a truck, Rubens said.

The body was found in a boxcar early today by a grain company employee; and indications are he was killed by blows in the face and kicks in the abdomen, according to Dr. T. L. Weeks. The man was dressed in a silk cowboy shirt and other Western clothing and the face bore evidence of grease paint 

Rubens said he believes Lopez was from Nashville Tenn.  He joined the circus either at Canton Ill, or Fort Madison la.
