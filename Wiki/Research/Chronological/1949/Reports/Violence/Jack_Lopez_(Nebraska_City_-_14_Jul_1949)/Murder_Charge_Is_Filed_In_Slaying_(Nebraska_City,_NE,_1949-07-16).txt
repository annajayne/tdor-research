===== Murder Charge Is Filed in Slaying Of Circus Worker =====

NEBRASKA CITY. Neb.—(UP)—First degree murder charges were filed today against an unemployed river boat worker who said he struck a 32-year-old female impersonator when he "took a pass at me."

County Attorney Otto Wellensiek said George O. Wells, jr., about 30, St. Joseph, Mo., admitted he struck the circus performer, Jack Lopez, in a boxcar several hours before Lopez body was found, brutally beaten in the car.

Wells told authorities he was asleep in the boxcar at about 1 a. m. Thursday when he was awakened by Lopez.

"He took a pass at me, Wells said, "and I shoved himaway. He came after me again and I let him have it with my hand. I didn t see what happened to him after that. It was dark and I jumped out of the car." Lopez, who worked for the Rog ers Brothers circus, was slain Friday. Police sought Wells because he had been seen with the victim prior to the slaying. He was arrested in his home yesterday and waived extradition.
