The body of Jack Lopez (Jesse Charles Dillard), age 27, a female impersonator with the Roger Brothers Circus, born 2 July, 1922 was found beaten to death in a rail boxcar on the morning of 14 July 1949. Lopez had been killed by blows in the face and kicks in the abdomen, according to Dr. T. L. Weeks. 

The body was found with toes and fingernails painted bright red, wearing a silk cowboy shirt, as well as other Western clothing, and the face bore evidence of grease paint. The hair on their head was long and the hair on their arms, legs, chest, and abdomen was shaved.

On 15 July, 1949, George O. Wells Jr., about 30 years old, was arrested for the murder at his home in St. Joseph, Missouri after witnesses recalled having seen him with Lopez on the day of the killing. He was charged with first degree murder on  16 July, 1949. He pleaded innocent.

Wells told authorities that he was asleep in the boxcar at about 1 a.m. on the 14th of July when he was awakened by Lopez.

"He took a pass at me," Wells said, "and I shoved him away. He came after me again and I let him have it with my hand. I didn't see what happened to him after that. It was dark and I jumped out of the car."

After a trial, Wells was acquited of manslaughter by a jury after the judge directed the jury to only consider that charge. Wells claimed he had acted in self defense, to prevent the man from making immoral advances.

This  appears to be a historical case of a successful use of the 'gay panic' defense. The account of the killing by Wells was completely at variance to the report of Dr T. L. Weeks, which documented a severe beating, including kicks to the abdomen, as the cause of Lopez's death.
