===== JURY STUDIES DEATH =====

INDIANAPOLIS (UPI)—Two men today faced a grand jury investigation in connection with the stabbing death of Freddie Jordan. 20, Christmas Day.

Raymond Craig, 22, and Joe Larry Long, 21, were arrested and police said Craig admitted stabbing Jordan with a pocket knife and told them Long was with him when the incident occurred.

Judge William T. Sharp, criminal court 4, ordered the men bound over to the grand jury after a preliminary hearing Saturday.

Police described Jordan as a "female impersonator" and said  when he was stabbed to death in his northside apartment he was wearing female clothing and makeup.

The stabbing occurred during an argument between Jordan and two men.
