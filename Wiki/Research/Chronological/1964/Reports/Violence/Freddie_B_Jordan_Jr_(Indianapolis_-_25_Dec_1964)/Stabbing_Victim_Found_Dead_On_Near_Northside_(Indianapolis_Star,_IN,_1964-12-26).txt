A man was found stabbed fatally in the abdomen and chest early yesterday morning, police said, at an apartment house where he lived, 2029 North College Avenue.

The man, Freddie B. Jordan, 26 years old, was clad in women's clothing. He was found lying in the hallway about 1:20 a.m. by his roommate, James Lee (Peaches) Green, 19, who said he went out to call police after two men who followed Jordan home started beating Jordan.

Green said the two men were leaving when he came back. One, described as 5 feet, 2 inches tall and of stocky build, was carrying a bloody knife, Green said. The other was about 6 feet, 2 inches tall and had a heavy mustache, according to witnesses.
