===== Murder Charge Is Dismissed =====

==== Key State Witness Disappears ====

A first-degree murder charge against an Indianapolis man was dismissed in Hancock Superior Court after the Marion County prosecutor's office was unable to produce a key state's witness.

The state requested a continuance in the case against Raymond A. Craig Wednesday on the second day of the trial which was refused by Judge George J. Lewis. The court granted one continuance in the case when: it came up for trial Jan. 16 when the state could not: locate the witness identified as "Peaches."

The prosecution moved for dismissal today and the motion was granted. A jury had been selected but had not been sworn.

Craig was accused of the fatal knifing of Freddie Jordan Jr. of Indianapolis. Jordan died on Christmas Day in 1964.

In examining prospective jurors the State's attorneys indicated that homosexuality might be involved in the case and police reported the dead man was dressed as a woman at the time he was wounded with a linoleum knife.

Hancock County prosecutor Ken McDermott, who was assisting the Marion County trial deputy in the case, said the whereabouts of "Peaches" was known Monday, but he had disappeared again. He said Indianapolis police scoured his known hangouts yesterday, but failed to find him.

McDermott said he did not know if an attempt would be made to indict Craig.
