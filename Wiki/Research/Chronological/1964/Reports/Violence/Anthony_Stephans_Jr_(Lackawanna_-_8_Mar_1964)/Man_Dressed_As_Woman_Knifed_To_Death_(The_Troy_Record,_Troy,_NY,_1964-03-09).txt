===== Man Dressed As Woman Knifed To Death =====

Lackawanna (AP) — A 22-year-old man clad in woman's clothing was stabbed to death yesterday after a round of drinking at several taverns with two other female impersonators, police reported.

The body of Anthony Stephans Jr., stabbed once in the neck, was found on a street.

His companions, Johnny P. Fields, 23, and Terrance Wilson, 29, said Stephans had walked off with a strange man who approached while Stephans and Wilson waited outside a tavern for Fields to return with their automobile.

Fields and Wilson were charges with masquerading in women's clothing and were held as material witnesses.
