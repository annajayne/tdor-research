Early on the morning of the 25th of December, 1964, Raymond Craig, 22, and Joe Larry Long, 21, followed Freddie B. Jordan, 26, wearing makeup and female clothing, and described as a "female impersonator", home to her apartment at 2029 North College Ave, Indianapolis, and began beating her.

Freddie's roommate, Peaches (James Lee) Green, 19, left to call police and on returning found her lying in the hallway with stab wounds to her abdomen and chest, and the two men leaving — one of them carrying a bloody linoleum knife.

The police arrived about 1:12 a.m. and Freddie was sent to the Indianapolis General Hospital, but died enroute.

Raymond A Craig was charged with 1st degree murder in the killing, and a trial was initially set for Jan. 16, 1964, but was continued to August when the state could not locate their key witness, Peaches. On Aug. 5th, the case was dismissed at the request of prosecutors before the jury was seated because they were again unable to locate Peaches to testify.

The case came back to life on 13 August, 1968, when a jury was seated for the charge of 1st degree murder, and testimony began. On the second day of the trial, 14 August, 1968, Raymond A Craig accepted a plea deal for manslaughter.
