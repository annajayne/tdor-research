shot
NOT ON TDOR LIST


Siavash, a 23-year-old trans man, was shot dead by his father in Khorramabad in August 2017, in what was described as an “honor killing". After making sure his son was dead, the father then killed himself. At that time, the Shesh-Rang website published news of the tragedy, but the family did not want the identity of their son revealed. Instead, the story referred to the death of a girl named Masoumeh, which had been Siavash’s name on his birth certificate. No photographs of Siavash were published alongside the article or on the mourning announcement.

> The obituary we received announced the deaths of both father and son at the same time. Reports indicate that the father shot his son after killing him. Apparently, Hossein/Siavash's identity as a trans man was not acceptable to the family.
> 
> But even after his death, in the obituary, his identity is denied: there is neither a “name” nor a “photo” of Siavash. Patriarchy, misogyny, and transphobia are evident even on this piece of paper.
> 
> This young trans man was murdered in a family where the image of a flower replaces the face of a human being and his entire identity, dreams, and future. And this reveals to us only a small part of his pain and suffering in the transphobic atmosphere of the family.

> We will continue our efforts to end the negative prejudices and taboos that lead to murder and violence against trans and gay Iranians, and in the hope of one day when parents accept the identity of their trans children as they are.
