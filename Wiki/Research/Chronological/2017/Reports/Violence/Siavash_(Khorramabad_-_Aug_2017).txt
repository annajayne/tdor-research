murdered


Siavash, a 23-year-old trans man, was shot dead by his father in Khorramabad in August 2017, in what was described as an “honor killing". After making sure his son was dead, the father then killed himself. At that time, the Shesh-Rang website published news of the tragedy, but the family did not want the identity of their son revealed. Instead, the story referred to the death of a girl named Masoumeh, which had been Siavash’s name on his birth certificate. No photographs of Siavash were published alongside the article or on the mourning announcement.
