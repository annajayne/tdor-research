>  A man was sentenced to 16 years and six months in prison for triple homicide against a 26-year-old transvestite known as Beyoncé. The crime took place in February 2017 in the Messejana neighborhood, in Fortaleza .
> 
> According to the Public Ministry of Ceará (MPCE), the convicted man, identified as Josimberg Rodrigues de Abreu, participated in the series of attacks that led to Beyoncé's death.
> 
> Josimberg used the back of a knife to attack the victim, who had already been beaten with punches and kicks. According to the Forensic Expert report, she died as a result of abdominal bleeding.
> 
> In the jury, prosecutor Marcus Renan Palácio de Morais Claro dos Santos, responsible for the prosecution in the case, argued that the crime was committed for transphobic reasons and that Josimberg acted with cruelty, since he subjected the already injured victim to intense physical and psychological suffering.
> 
> The jury sentenced Josimberg to pay R$20,000 in compensation to the victim's family, in addition to serving 16 years and six months in prison for triple-qualified homicide – by base motive, cruel means and use of a means that made it impossible for the victim to defend himself. The convicted man can appeal the sentence, but will begin serving his sentence immediately.
> 
> Beyoncé's death occurred just ten days after the murder of transvestite Dandara in the Bom Jardim neighborhood, also in Fortaleza. The case had international repercussions and led to the conviction of 7 of the 8 people involved in the crime - one of them died before going to trial.
> 
> Prosecutor Marcus Renan, who also worked on the case that led to the conviction of the eight people responsible for Dandara's death, highlighted that Ceará is the third state in Brazil with the highest number of murders of trans and transvestite people. "The numbers are probably higher, since many of the cases are underreported," he highlighted.
> 
> The crime
> On February 25, 2017, Beyoncé and a friend were walking and passed in front of an establishment, where there was a group that started to offend the friends with transphobic insults.
> 
> The victim then reacted and approached the group to complain. At that moment, the attack began, with Beyoncé being hit with punches and blows. The friend she was with managed to pull her away from the focus of the attack, and the two staggered away from the scene.
> 
> However, a little further on, Beyoncé fell unconscious on the sidewalk of a fish shop where Josimberg worked. He then allegedly joined in the attack and injured the transvestite with the back of a knife he used to cut fish.
> 
> After this second attack, the two friends managed to escape and reach the house of a third friend, from where Beyoncé was taken to the Messejana Emergency Care Unit (UPA), complaining of severe abdominal pain. She died at the scene, with closed abdominal hemorrhage.
> 
> According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, Josimberg contributed to the crime, that is, he contributed to the murder of the victim. The others involved in the initial attack have not been identified.




> The Justice of Ceará pronounced the man accused of beating and stabbing the transvestite Beyoncé (social name) in Fortaleza to a popular jury. JosimBerg Rodrigues de Abreu will be tried for triple murder. The crime took place in February 2017, in the Messejana neighborhood. According to the complaint, the murder was homophobic in motive.
> 
> According to the indictment, Josimberg acted cruelly by subjecting the victim to intense physical and mental suffering. The transvestite was killed by blows with a knife with a closed abdominal trauma. She was rescued by witnesses, but she couldn't resist. The accused alleges to have acted in self-defence, a thesis rejected by the 1st Jury of the Comarca of Fortaleza.
> 
> The judicial order points out that the man would have acted "impregnated with undue social prejudices and by a reprehensible and repugnant homophobic feeling". the need to employ violent means used in crime under the argument of self-defense.
> 
> The court's decision is based on a complaint by the Public Ministry of Ceará (MPCE) filed in the same year as the crime. The accusatory piece maintains that Josimberg committed the murder using clumsiness, cruelty and a resource that made it impossible for the victim to defend himself. The violent practices mentioned by the MPCE were the same used by the Justice to classify homicide as triple qualified. The trial date has yet to be set.
