===== Three Men Indicted On Murder Charges =====

NEW ORLEANS (UPI) â€” Three men, including a defendant in a heroin distribution case, have been indicted for the murder of two prosecution witnesses.

Indicted Thursday for two counts of first degree murder each were David Joseph Sylvester, who is facing trial for intent to distribute heroin, Clarence Davis, 21, and his brother, Nelson Davis.

Sylvester and Clarence Davis are both in jail, but Nelson Davis is still at large.

Police said three gunmen killed female impersonator Eddie Smith, 30, and French Quarter prostitute Paulette Royal, 18, at their motel room July 20.

The shootings occurred within a few hours of their appearance at a pretrial hearing for Sylvester.

Samuel Williams, 22, of Alexandria, a friend of Smith and Miss Royal, was seriously wounded in the shooting.

Smith and Miss Royal had been kept in Alexandria for protection but the defense for Sylvester won a court order forcing them to return to New Orleans for pretrial hearings.

Sylvester was free on $30,000 bail at the time of the shootings. The next day bail was increased to $70,000 and Sylvester surrendered himself to police.

Clarence Davis was arrested two days later.

District Attorney Harry Connick bitterly complained that the witnesses should not have been forced to appear in court.

Connick said he had understood that the witnesses would be given protection, but a Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman said both witnesses had refused federal protection.
