Eddie Smith, 29, who performed in the French Quarter as female impersonator "Miss Edith," and Paulette Royal, 17, were each shot three times in the head on 20 Jul., 1976 in a motel room in New Orleans.

They were killed hours after appearing as witnesses at a pre-trial hearing in a narcotics case in an apparent effort to silence them.

David Joseph Sylvester, who was facing trial for intent to distribute heroin, Clarence Davis, 21, and his brother, Nelson Davis, were all charged with first degree murder in their deaths.
