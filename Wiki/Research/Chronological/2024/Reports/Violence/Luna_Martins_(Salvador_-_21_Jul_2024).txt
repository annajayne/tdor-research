> The deaths of a young woman, identified as Crislane, and a transgender woman, known as Luna Martins, may be related, according to information gathered by the Alô Juca program , on TV Aratu. The two, who were friends, were executed last Sunday (21/7), in the São Caetano region, just a few hours apart.
> 
> Luna and Crislane were at a party in a place known as Formiga. After the case became public, a video of Cris receiving a “revelation” at church was shared on social media, where she was warned not to go to the place, days before the crime.
> 
> Cris, who lived in another neighborhood, was allegedly killed by armed men after leaving the party. Luna was executed in the afternoon with more than 10 gunshots. The family of the woman, who was transgender, believes that drug dealers in the area killed her because they believed she had something to do with the death of young Crislane.



> A person was shot dead on Sunday afternoon (21/7), in the Boa Vista neighborhood of São Caetano, in Salvador. According to an investigation by the Alô Juca website, the victim was a young transgender woman, known as Luna, and was shot more than ten times.
> 
> The crime took place near a staircase on Yolanda Street and she died at the scene. The perpetrator and motive for the crime are still unknown.
> 
> “I think [the death] has no connection with drug trafficking, but only God knows what happened,” Luna’s brother told Alô Juca.
> 
> Luna's death was the second violent death in the neighborhood this Sunday. In the morning, a young woman named Crislane was executed with several gunshots in the area known as Formiga. Both homicides are being investigated by the Civil Police.
