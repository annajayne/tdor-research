> A body with signs of blows to the head and bleeding was found abandoned in a forest in a deserted location, on the banks of a lagoon in the Duquesa 2 neighborhood, in Santa Luzia, in the metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte. The Military Police received the information via Dial 190 this Saturday morning (March 16). So far, it has not been possible to identify the person. 
> 
> According to the Military Police, it is a male body “dressed as a woman”, that is, the clothing worn is a dress. As no identity card was found and nearby residents were unable to identify the person, however, it is not possible to say whether the victim is a transvestite. “That's the detail. The person was wearing a black, printed dress. We continued trying to identify it, but without many clues so far. Some residents said they suspected he was a homosexual, but no one really knew the victim”, says Lieutenant Milanez, one of the police officers who responded to the incident. 
> 
> The soldier reported that the body was found lying and tilted diagonally (“turned on its side”). He appears to be around 40 years old and had a head injury and bleeding from his mouth and nose. Civil Police expertise was called in to try to investigate what type of object was used to hit the victim. 
> 
> No suspect has been identified so far. The location does not have security cameras nearby. Anyone who has any information that could assist in the investigations can say so anonymously through Hotline 181.
