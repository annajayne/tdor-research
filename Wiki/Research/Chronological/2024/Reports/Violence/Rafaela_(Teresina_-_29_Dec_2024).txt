The body was identified by her family yesterday (29), around 11 pm, at the Forensic Medical Institute. The bodies of Rafaela and a man, who remains unidentified, were found decomposing late yesterday afternoon by locals in a vacant lot used to dispose of garbage in the region.

According to police chief Francisco Costa Barreta, the distance between the bodies was minimal. The press has received information that the two victims had their eyes gouged out, but the police are waiting for the autopsy report from the Forensic Medical Institute, which will determine this information.
> 
> "Look! The two bodies were found in a place that was used as a garbage dump by the population. Animals, such as vultures, were seen there, and this type of injury could have been caused by the action of animals. So we need to wait for the IML to determine if this happened," he determined.

The victims, a man and a trans woman, were found about 15 meters away from each other, on a dirt road that connects the Monte Verde neighborhood to Residencial Jacinta Andrade.
> 
> The Military Police were called by people who were passing by the area and noticed one of the bodies lying on the ground. When searching the surrounding area, the teams, made up of the 13th PM Battalion, Planned Operations and General Operations Department (DGO), identified the second victim.
> 
> According to aspirant Cantuária, from the 13th BPM, both bodies showed signs of lethal violence . 
> 
> "The information we have been able to gather at the moment is that the two bodies were probably victims of gunshots. The average time between deaths is 24 hours. One of the bodies had a card with the name Rafael, but only after the forensic work and information from the investigative police will we be able to truly confirm the identities," said the officer.
> 
> The bodies had characteristics that caught the attention of the authorities. The trans woman was wearing a white shirt, black shorts and was carrying underwear in her bra. Both bodies had their eyes pierced, injuries confirmed to be the result of gunshots. According to the police, this type of injury could be a message in the context of organized crime, indicating that the victims "saw too much" .
> 
> Although the  expert did not identify any apparent signs of beating , the possibility of other injuries will be analyzed by the Legal Medical Institute (IML). 
> 
> "They [experts] were unable to identify this type of injury, at least here at the site. More information regarding this type of investigation will come after the IML's work," the candidate said.
> 
> The  location where the bodies were found also indicated that the murders took place there. 
> 
> "This can be confirmed by the marks on the ground," the police officer explained. However, no bullet cases were found, which could make it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the crime.
> 
> According to information from reporter Lucas Rangel, both the trans woman and the boy were linked to the death of teenager Jeniffer Lourrane Gomes de Sousa, 16 years old, one of the victims of the series of murders on the night of October 3. Jennifer was the daughter of a member of the gang known as 'Pimenta' who was murdered in 2018.
> 
> The Civil Police, through the Homicide and Personal Protection Department (DHPP) , took over the investigation of the case. The identities of the victims and the motives behind the homicides are still unknown, but authorities are working with the hypothesis that the execution was related to organized crime.
