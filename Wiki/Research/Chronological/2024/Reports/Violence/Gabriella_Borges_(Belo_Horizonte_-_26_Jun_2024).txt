hanged



> The body of Minas Gerais artist Gabriella da Silva Borges, 50, was found inside her apartment in the Santo André neighborhood, in the northwest region of Belo Horizonte, on the evening of Wednesday (26/6). The trans woman, who participated in parades and lip sync battles in the capital - lip synchronization performances -, lived in Italy for more than 20 years and returned to Brazil every year to spend vacations and see relatives and friends.
> 
> Gabi Campbel was an educated, kind, hard-working and warrior woman. Adjectives that, according to Walkiria La Roche, State Director of Diversity Policies of Minas Gerais, are in the nature of the long-time friend. 
> 
> To Estado de Minas , Walkiria said that Gabi was fascinated by lace, a more realistic type of wig. From the passion for props, the Minas Gerais company structured itself in the European market and established itself in Italy. According to the state's diversity policy director, the friend celebrated her 50th birthday last week. 
> 
> “I’ve known Gabi for over two decades. She comes to Brazil every year during the European summer and stays for about three months, usually until my birthday in September. She was a very happy, beautiful, fun, good-natured, generous and polite woman. The kind of person who almost doesn’t exist anymore,” laments her friend. 
> 
> Through social media, the Center for the Fight for Free Sexual Orientation of Minas Gerais mourned the death of Gabi Campbel. The entity demanded that the case be explained and the culprits held accountable. “Our hearts are saddened by family and friends.” 
> 
> The inclusive nightclub Athenas Dancing Club also mourned the “premature and tragic” loss of the artist. “Her departure leaves an immeasurable void in the LGBTQIAPN+ art world, in the lives of everyone who had the privilege of knowing her work and her person. Rest in peace, Gabi Campbell. Her light will continue to shine through her work, eternally alive in our hearts.” 
> 
> The crime 
> Gabi Campbel's body was found, in an advanced state of putrefaction, inside her apartment in the Santo André neighborhood. The Military Police (PM) were called by the condominium's sub-syndic after neighbors began to smell a bad smell coming from the residence and noticed the resident was missing.
> 
> According to the police report, the officers used force to break down the door of the property and found the woman lying on the bed in one of the bedrooms, with a blanket wrapped around her body and already dead. In addition to the victim's car, which was not in the garage, a friend said that her cell phone was also not in the apartment, despite someone accessing her social networks and responding to messages.
> 
> The data of the Fiat Renegade vehicle was passed on to the police and, in the early hours of this Thursday (27/6), it was found with two women, aged 18 and 22, in the Aparecida neighborhood, in the Northwest region of the city. In their statements, they reported that they were in a bar when a friend asked them to take the wheel and deliver the vehicle to him on a nearby street. On the way, they were approached.
> 
> The suspects were arrested for receiving stolen goods. The 43-year-old man was identified but has not yet been arrested. The Civil Police forensics team and the coroner's office were called. It is suspected that Gabi was the victim of hanging. The case is still under investigation. 
> 
> The motivation for the crime has not yet been clarified. Asked by the report if Gabi was being threatened or had any disagreements, Walkiria La Roche, State Director of Diversity Policies for Minas Gerais, said no. 
> 
> “She wasn't being threatened, she was happy, she just talked about good things, shows, the Lip Sync Drag Battle. She was calm, just laughing. She was a very happy, beautiful, fun, good-humored, generous, polite woman,” said the friend.
