> They murder a 'trans' in Cárdenas 'Kenia' denounced and beat him to death
> CARDENAS. Pedro 'N', also known as Kenia, had reported mistreatment by a group of young people, which led to the imprisonment of one of them. Yesterday, the young trans man was found lifeless in the patio of his house, after being brutally beaten.
> 
> The alleged hate crime occurred in the second section of the La Azucena ranchería, where the lifeless body of the young man, approximately 20 years old, was found. The night before, Kenia was seen hanging out with a group of people until the wee hours.
> 
> HIS MOTHER FOUND IT
> 
> Ana Julia, her adoptive mother, discovered the tragedy when she noticed Kenia's absence in the morning. Walking out to the front yard, she found him under a tree. Thinking that he was asleep, she went to wake him up, but sadly he was already lifeless.
> 
> The State Attorney General's Office handles at least two lines of investigation. One of them is the death threats that Kenia received from a neighbor, whose statement led to the imprisonment of the woman's son.
> 
> THE PARTY
> 
> The second line of investigation points to a possible conflict during the party the night before.
> 
> When the body was lifted, it had several blows to different parts of the extremities; however, it was on the skull where a contusion pointed to the cause of death.
> 
> The body was lifted by experts and transferred to the FGE Forensic Medical Service.
