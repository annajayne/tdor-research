> The first of these was reported on August 30, when a body was found with a bullet wound to the head, at kilometer 32 of the highway from Chihuahua to Ciudad Juárez. Several local media outlets reported the news under the headline “execution found dressed as a woman,” however, Mayte Regina Gardea, spokesperson for the organizationUnion and Strength of Trans Women of Chihuahua, strongly rejected the reporting of the event.
> 
> Mayte explained that the person found on the road was a 37-year-old trans woman, known as “La China,” who had just begun her sex-gender transition process (before that, the person identified as Jaime Encuentras Rivas) and was dedicated to sex work due to the lack of job opportunities she had, as well as the prejudice and rejection that exists against these people.
> 
> In this regard, the activist called on local authorities to conduct the investigations into both murders that occurred in the last fifteen days from a gender perspective and not rule out the possibility that they are hate crimes against the trans community.
> 
> “We are in a state where access to justice for us trans women is non-existent, it is lacking in empathy, it is prejudiced, it does not consider or adhere to human rights, much less to the gender perspective,” Mayte pointed out.



> Chihuahua, Chih.- Authorities have identified the man who was found executed last Friday in a field located at kilometer 32 of the highway to Ciudad Juarez. The victim, who had a "coup de grace" wound, was identified as Jaime Encuentras Rivas, 37 years old.
> 
> The body of Encuentras Rivas was located by police officers, who went to the scene after receiving a report. The victim was dressed in a black dress and had a bullet wound to the head. At the crime scene, two spent shell casings were found.
> 
> The area was cordoned off by municipal police officers while the Public Prosecutor's Office began initial investigations to clarify the murder.
