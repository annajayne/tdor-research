We will remember you with your joy, your pompadours, your outfits that you wore every night and that you paraded for us, your spectacular participation in the last pride march on the Casa Roja float, your solidarity in each collection, your participation in the assemblies . “, you and all your projects that encouraged you to get ahead and help your family in Ecuador.”

> In communication with Página|12 Orellano added: “We demand justice and also public policies that can serve and provide support to colleagues who are going through situations of gender violence.

> A repeated story
> 
> On Tuesday, his colleagues gathered demanding justice at the door of the police station where the only one detained for the transvesticicide is located, which adds to the 85 femicides and transvesticides throughout the country recorded to date by the Lucía Pérez Observatory. During March alone, 18 of these events occurred, in addition to 3 children being murdered. In 2023 there will be a victim of gender violence every 26 hours, according to a report by the NGO La Casa del Encuentro. From January 1 to December 31, 307 femicides were recorded, 4 trans/transvesticides and 23 linked femicides of men.
> 
> The case of Dámaris, as a trans woman, migrant and prostitute, does not escape the systematic vulnerability to which these people are exposed. This intersectionality (that sum of exclusion categories) is evident in different studies such as the one carried out in the period 2016 to 2021, in which jurisdictions throughout the country reviewed judicial cases related to violent deaths due to gender, following the Protocol of the National Registry of Femicides of the Argentine Justice (RNFJA). This study identified that victims of transvesticide/transfemicide were an average of 32 years old at the time of the event, being younger compared to cis women victims of feminicide in the same period.
> 
> Furthermore, a third of the victims were of foreign origin, mainly from other Latin American countries, and more than half were dedicated to prostitution, a much higher proportion than that of cis female victims. Regarding the relationship with those who committed the crimes, the participation of partners and ex-partners appears in one in five cases. Furthermore, almost half of the victims had not requested judicial protection measures during the period studied.
