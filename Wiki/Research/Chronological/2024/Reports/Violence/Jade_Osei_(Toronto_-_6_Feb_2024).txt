> Hello everyone, I am organizing a planned memorial for my sister jade. She was a beautiful free spirited black transwoman who met her end at the hands of intimate partner violence on her own birthday. Jade was the kind of person who the party didn't start until she rolled through.
> 
> Her smile, her laugh, turned a party that was on 10 to 1000. She was never afraid to say hello and put herself out there no matter how mean or scary a person or situation might seem. Many would say "she was outside" and our girl was always outside. Doing her best to live life to the fullest.She never let the opinions of people who judged her or mistreated her for being trans stop her from living her life.
> 
> On february 5th 2024 Jade's boyfriend had become unhinged and she was trying to escape the situation. She tried contacting me but because my boyfriend was already spending the night I was unavailable. The next morning she was found dead in her boyfriend's apartment and he could not be located.
> 
> I tried my best to provide the police the evidence of our conversation about her wanting to escape him. The police did not seem to care very much. Seemed to me that Far as they were concerned another black transwoman dead is not a priority.
> 
> The police investigation was in a state of limbo while her body lay in cold storage for ages. Until they randomly decided to close the case and no justice would be found for my sister. Many times when black transwomen are murdered we are seen as bottom of the barrel by society and no one cares what happens to us.
> 
> Which is why this memorial is so important for those to know & remember the amazing woman she was that this cruel world never deserved. I do not want her memory to end with her buried under a dead name she never identified with. These funds will help go towards her being remembered with the dignity and respect she deserves as a beautiful, courageous black transwoman.




> I'm sharing the last message between me and my sister, Jade. She was trying to escape her boyfriend, who was becoming unstable and very toxic. Unfortunately, I couldn't have her at my house because my boyfriend was spending the night that day. It's one of the biggest regrets of my life: not being there for my sister in her time of need. That's why I'm trying so hard to be there for her right now. I don't know if any of you have media influence or police contacts, but something needs to be done. The person who did this to my sister has a history of murdering her using the same method. It's a crime to inject drugs into people's necks, with or without their consent, yet he's walking around free! I want justice for my sister! He left her DEAD in her apartment while he ran away. If he had called the paramedics, lifesaving measures could have been taken to save her life! He discarded her, she was trash, because he knew Black trans women are considered the lowest of the low.
