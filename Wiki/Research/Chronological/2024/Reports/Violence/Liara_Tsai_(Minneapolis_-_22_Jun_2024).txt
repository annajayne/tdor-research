> IOWA CITY, Iowa — An Iowa City woman was found dead in her car, being driven by her ex-partner, in Minnesota over the weekend.
> 
> Margot Lewis, a 32-year-old from North Liberty, is being charged with second-degree murder and interference with/and concealing a dead body.
> 
> Investigators believe Lewis stabbed and killed Liara Tsai at her apartment before she ended up in the back seat of her own car.
> 
> People in Iowa City honored Tsai by holding a remembrance event at Gabe's downtown on Thursday night.
> 
> Gabe's is a big live music venue, so loved ones said it's fitting to honor Tsai's legacy there.
> 
> Tsai recently moved from Iowa City to Minneapolis, hoping to broaden her career as a music producer and DJ in the twin cities.
> 
> In fact, friends said she'd just been booked for her biggest gig ever. But she never got to play that show.
> 
> Now, those who knew Tsai are in shock at the 35-year-old's sudden and violent death.
> 
> The trans community is mourning the loss, calling Tsai an incredible artist, fearless and unmasked. Many said Tsai's strength as a trans woman was an inspiration to the trans community.



> Charges: Ex-partner flew to Minnesota and murdered Liara Tsai before concealing body
> Her bond has been set at $1.5 million and she faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted.
> Margot Lewis, the woman behind the wheel of a car crash that resulted in the discovery of a body in the back seat last weekend, has now been charged in Hennepin County District Court for the murder of 35-year-old transgender woman Liara Tsai. 
> 
> Tsai was found in the back of her own car, which Lewis was driving and crashed in Olmsted County on the morning of June 22. According to the second-degree murder charges, Lewis was Tsai's former romantic partner. 
> 
> When deputies arrived at the scene of the crash, they discovered Tsai's body, wrapped in bedding that was soaked with blood. The criminal complaint says Tsai suffered multiple sharpe force injuries, including a puncture wound to her neck. 
> 
> Investigators obtained a search warrant to search Tsai's studio apartment in Minneapolis, and they found a bloody scene, "noting the victim's bed and bedding were saturated with blood." There was also a butcher's knife missing from the apartment. 
> 
> According to her friends, Tsai had told them she had a "friend" from out of town come to stay with her, and police confirmed this, finding an airline flight tag in the car that confirmed Lewis flew to Minneapolis from Boston on June 21.
> 
> MSP Airport surveillance footage showed Tsai picking up Lewis that day. When police spoke with a former parter of Tsai's, they confirmed Tsai's relationship with Lewis "sordid and emotionally challenging."
> 
> Since her arrest, Lewis has refused to cooperate with the police, taking a "vow of silence" and using sign language to communicate instead. When she was informed officers needed to get evidence from her, she became combative, allegedly kicking and pushing them away from her.
> 
> Bond has been set at $1.5 million and Lewis faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted. She is also charged with crimes in Olmsted County for attempting to conceal a body and obstruction of the legal process.

> June 25, 2024 — 11:41am
> 
> A 32-year-old woman was charged Tuesday with a felony following the discovery of a Minneapolis murder victim's body being found in a car the woman was driving when she crashed on a southern Minnesota interstate over the weekend.
> 
> Margot G. Lewis, of New Liberty, Iowa, was charged in Olmsted County District Court with interference with a dead body in connection with the death of 35-year-old Liara Tsai.
> 
> The criminal complaint makes no mention of whether Lewis or someone else killed Tsai, who worked as a techno/electronic DJ at various events and also was active on behalf of the trans community.
> 
> Lewis, who was arrested about 7 a.m. Saturday at the scene of the crash on eastbound Interstate 90 south of Eyota, appeared in court Tuesday morning and remains jailed. Court records do not yet list an attorney for her.
> 
> The Southern Minnesota Medical Examiner's Office identified Tsai on Tuesday as the victim but has yet to disclose how she was killed. A Minneapolis police officer's report filed Saturday night classified Tsai's death as a case of murder, noting that the weapon involved was a knife or other "cutting instrument." The complaint noted that a deputy at the scene saw large wound to her neck around the carotid artery.
> 
> Minneapolis police became involved in the case Saturday afternoon when the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension requested that officers do a welfare check at Tsai's home in the 700 block of E. 16th Street. Officers searched the residence and saw "a scene indicating violence," a statement from police read.
> 
> According to the complaint:
> 
> A deputy sent to the crash scene saw the subcompact car — owned by Tsai — in the center median and Lewis sitting in a folding chair that was provided by a bystander. The deputy determined that Lewis was speeding when she hit a guardrail that surrounded the pillars of an overpass.
> 
> The deputy opened the car's passenger-side back door and saw Tsai's body on the folded-down seat. It was wrapped in a bed sheet, blanket, futon-style mattress and a tarp. She was cold to the touch.
> 
> "It was apparent [to the deputy] that the death ... was not a result of the traffic crash," the complaint read.
> 
> Upon her being booked into the jail, Lewis "did not respond audibly to detention staff or investigators," the complaint continued.
> 
> Steven Seuling, who stages events and would hire Tsai as a DJ, said the two of them spoke on Friday ahead of her being scheduled to work an event Sunday at the Pourhouse in downtown Minneapolis.
> 
> "She said a friend was coming to stay with her," Seuling said of his friend for the past six years or so and added that she moved to Minneapolis from Iowa last winter. "I checked in with her by text on Saturday, but she didn't answer, which was very unusual for her."
> 
> When the time came for her to play [Sunday] and she didn't show up, "we were really freaking out. It was very unlike her not to be there," he said.
> 
> Seuling described Tsai as "community and trans activist. She was very, very much more than just a DJ."
