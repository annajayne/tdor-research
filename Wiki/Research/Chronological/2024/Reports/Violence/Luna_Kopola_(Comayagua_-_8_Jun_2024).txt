beaten and burned



> Tegucigalpa, Honduras - Last Saturday, Luna Kopola, a trans woman and creator of entertainment content for social networks, was found dead in a hotel room in the Torondón neighborhood of Comayagua, central Honduras.
> 
> A priori, the police attributed this violent death to a murder caused by “beatings”, and revealed that the hotel room (where the TikToker lived) seemed to have traces of a fire.
> 
> According to the version handled by Grecia O'hara, a trans activist from the organization Center for LGBTI Development and Cooperation, Kopola was with another person in the room, with whom the victim would have argued prior to the criminal act. It is assumed that the person responsible for the crime (unknown until now) would have tied up and then beaten the victim until he died.
> 
> The sexual diversity activist pointed out that Luna Kopola was not associated with any LGBTI organization, however, she was a recognized person in these spaces due to her notable content published on the TikTok platform.
> 
> For years, intolerance and hatred have marked a dark path for LGBTI people, who are constantly victims of hate crimes, such as the one perpetrated against Luna Kopola.
> 
> Gender identity is often seen as a controversial topic full of taboos within the Honduran population, leading to LGBTIQ+ people being violated and discriminated against, awakening fear and anguish in those who try to show their real version to the world.
