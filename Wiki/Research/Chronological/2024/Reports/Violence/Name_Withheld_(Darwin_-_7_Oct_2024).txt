> Darwin's queer and Tiwi community is mourning the death of a sistergirl after she was stabbed in the backyard of her home.
> 
> Sistergirl is a term used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to describe gender-diverse people that have a female spirit and take on female roles in the community.
> 
> Crystal Love, the matriarch of Tiwi sistergirls, said she had lost part of herself when her daughter was killed on Monday.
> 
> The victim's name is not being used for cultural reasons.
> 
> "We are living in a world that is all messed up ... she was good person, a kind person," Aunty Crystal said.
> 
> "She had a good life, she had family and friends who love her, our communities that love her, but it was just tragic, because ... sometimes some people have bigger dreams, she had those."
> 
> Members of the Tiwi sistergirl community refer to Aunty Crystal as mother, as she has advocated to bring both culture and western worlds together for Indigenous transgender communities.
> 
> Northern Territory Police said they were called to a unit complex in Darwin's northern suburb of Malak about 9:35pm where officers found the victim unconscious in the backyard, with a stab wound in her chest.
> 
> Senior Sergeant John Beer said witnesses were helping police with the investigation, which was being treated as a domestic violence-related death.
> 
> "I know there were a number of people at the location and we're obviously conducting inquiries in relation to who was actually there," he said. 
> 
> Officers performed CPR but the 37-year-old was declared dead after paramedics arrived. 
> 
> Police say a 34-year-old man, believed to be related to the victim, was arrested at the scene and is expected to be charged later on Tuesday.




> Police have arrested a 34-year-old man after a Tiwi sistergirl was stabbed to death on the night of the 7th of October at a residence in Malak, Darwin.
> 
> Emergency services attended the scene where 37-year-old sistergirl, who is not named by [name redacted] for Indigenous cultural reasons, was found with a stab wound to her chest.
> 
> Officers performed CPR for twenty minutes, however she was declared dead at the scene.
> 
> Speaking to the ABC, a friend of the victim, Crystal Love Johnson, said that the victim “had everything going for her”.
> 
> "She wanted to make her dreams come true, she wanted to live her life how she wanted to live it.”
> 
> Disappointingly, the media release by the NT Police & Emergency Services misgenders the victim repeatedly.
> 
> It also appears that Commander Patterson of the NT Police additionally misgendered the victim in an ABC News Darwin interview, where ABC had to correct the commander in the articles. However this cannot be confirmed.
> 
> This raises the question of how NT Police can be trusted to investigate the deaths of transgender and gender-diverse people properly and without prejudice if they are unable or unwilling to refer to us appropriately.
> 
> I’ve put these questions to the NT Police media team and have not yet heard back.
> 
> Anyone with information about the stabbing who has not yet spoken to police is urged to contact 131 444 or Crime Stoppers at 1800 333 000.
