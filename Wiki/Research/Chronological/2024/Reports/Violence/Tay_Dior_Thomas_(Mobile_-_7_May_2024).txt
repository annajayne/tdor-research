> 
> In the early morning hours of Monday, May 6, 2024, a father called 911 to report that his 17 year old son had shot a friend in a car. The friend was a 18 year old trans woman named Jazlynn Johnson. Carson City Nevada police responded, took the shooter into custody, and declared Jazlynn dead at the scene.
> 
> The next day, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, police in Mobile, Alabama responded to reports of gunfire at the 1600 block of Darwood Drive around 3:30 a.m. Later that day, police arrested Carl Mitchell Washington Jr., 20, of Mobile. According to court paperwork, Washington fired 18 shots at the 17-year-old victim, Tay Dior.
> 
> The suspect in the Carson City shooting has not been identified because he is a minor. The Las Vegas Review Journal reports that if he is charged as an adult, his name will be released.
> 
> Sadly, a lot of the media and even family content misgenders and uses their deadnames. Not all.
> 
> I have not found much about Jazlynn or her family. She has a Facebook profile. Jazlynn was from Dillingham Alaska and has been living in Carson City, Nevada. She was a senior of Pioneer Academy. She recently told the media that she planned to become a diesel mechanic through her participation in the Jobs For Nevada’s Graduates. Jazlynn may have ties to Indigenous peoples in Alaska, but it is not confirmed.
> 
> Tay has a Facebook profile styled Tayy Dior. She was born and raised in Mobile. She had a twin brother, Braeden and two other siblings. She worked at AMC Theaters. Her friends are posting countless tributes. Her aunt claimed that with her “last breath she made sure to text her best friend who did it.” Tay’s family has established a crowdfund to help with her final expenses. No word on final arrangements for either girl.
> 
> Tay was scheduled to graduate this week. I believe Jazlynn would be graduating at the end of May. Hopefully more information will come to light in the coming days.
> 
> Jazlynn Johnson is the 17th trans person whose death is recorded in 2024. She is the 11th trans woman. I am not certain of her ethnic identity just yet.
> 
> Tay Dior is the 18th trans person whose death is recorded in 2024. She is the 12th trans woman on this list, the 13th trans person. of color, the fifth Black trans woman, and the seventh Black trans person.
> 
> This year, we have documented the deaths of four high school students, connected by a rhetoric of hate and violence. None of these kids will graduate high school. We know one student was assaulted in their school. We know another ran away from all of their family, but maintained some connection with their peers. We know on was shot by another teen, possibly a classmate? What was school like for all of them? It seems they had varying degrees of family support. Their vulnerabilities are not inherent with the trans experience, but it is essential to understand that their identity is absolutely a part of who they are, stem to stern.
> 
> Nex Benedict was 16. River Nevaeh was 17. Tay Dior was also 17. And Jazlynn Johnson was 18.
> 
> As of today, we have documented the death of a trans neighbor every 7.1 days. That window is narrowing every week. The year isn’t half over. What are we doing to protect trans kids?
> 
> Jazlynn and Tay, you had the world in front of you. That should still be the case. Thank you for bringing joy and creativity into our world. Thank you for being typical teens and also uniquely your own selves. I am so very sorry that we did not protect you. I hope we can tell your stories more robustly. It matters that you walked with us, even if for too short a time.
> 
> May your memories be a revolution.
