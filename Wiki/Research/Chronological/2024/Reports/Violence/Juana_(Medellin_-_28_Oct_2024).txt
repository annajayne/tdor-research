> October 29, 2024 – This morning, the community of the Manrique Central neighborhood was shocked after the discovery of the bodies of two LGBTIQ+ people, both with multiple stab wounds. One of the victims has been preliminarily identified as Juana, a trans woman and well-known activist for the LGBTIQ+ population in Medellín. The authorities have launched an investigation into the case, which is analyzing whether there are security cameras in the area that could help identify those responsible.
> 
> According to initial reports, the victims met their attackers in a bar in the Téjelo sector, in the city centre. They then headed together towards the northeast of Medellín, where the attack occurred. A third person, who managed to escape the attack, alerted the authorities and gave his initial testimony about the events. The police are making progress in the investigation and are assessing the surroundings of the crime scene to clarify the details and responsibilities of this double homicide, which represents a new act of violence against the LGBTIQ+ community. 
> 
> With these two victims, the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory records a total of 40 people belonging to the LGBTIQ+ community murdered in Colombia. This alarming number reflects a worrying trend of violence and discrimination towards this vulnerable group. It is important to highlight that at least half of these victims are trans people, which underlines the particular vulnerability of this subpopulation within the LGBTIQ+ community. To date, 22 murders of trans people have been documented in Colombia during the year, according to information collected by the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory. These data not only show the urgent need for specific protection policies and measures for the trans community, but also highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach that addresses the multiple forms of violence and discrimination faced by LGBTIQ+ people in the country.


> The Manrique Central community in Medellín woke up on Tuesday to the news of a double homicide that has shocked the local population. Two people belonging to the LGBTIQ+ community , including a well-known trans activist known as Juana , were found dead inside a home. Both bodies had multiple stab wounds, which has led the authorities to launch an operation to find those responsible for this violent act.
> 
> According to preliminary reports, the victims had attended a party in a section of downtown Medellín, and afterward, they decided to continue the celebration at a house in Manrique Central. It was there that, in the midst of the drinks, a fight broke out between the attendees, triggering the attack. A third person, who managed to escape from the house, was the one who notified the authorities, after showing up wounded at a health center. The person said he had witnessed the attack and provided initial information about what happened.
> 
> The commander of the Metropolitan Police of the Aburrá Valley, Brigadier General William Castaño Ramos, reported that, after receiving the report, the security forces went to the place to secure the scene and carry out the pertinent investigations. “Today, a man arrived at a health center stating that he had witnessed an act of intolerance in which two people had lost their lives, specifically in the Manrique sector. The Police were informed and deployed all their capabilities to locate the house where the victims were found,” said Castaño, who also confirmed that Criminal Investigation officials are supporting the case to identify, prosecute and capture those responsible.
> 
> The Technical Investigation Corps (CTI) of the Attorney General's Office has begun the technical inspection of the bodies and is working on collecting evidence to determine the sequence of events. The deceased were identified as Juana C., 33 years old, and Oswaldo R., 53 years old.
> 
> This double homicide has rekindled concerns about the violence faced by the LGBTIQ+ community in the country. Human rights organisations, such as Caribe Afirmativo, have expressed concern about the increase in attacks against people from this community in Colombia. According to their records, so far this year, 40 LGBTIQ+ people have been murdered in the country, of which 22 are trans people , a group that faces particular vulnerability. The organisation has asked the authorities to investigate the case under the hypothesis of a crime motivated by prejudice, given the recurrent documented violence against this population.
