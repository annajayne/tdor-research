> The director of the Scientific, Criminal and Criminal Investigation Corps (CICPC), Douglas Rico, reported on March 13 the clarification of the homicide of Erik Gabriel Rada Hernández, 36 years old, a member of the LGBTIQ+ community. 
> 
> Rada Hernández, known to those close to him as Montserrat, was murdered on March 4 on land in the Sojo Industrial Zone of Guatire, Miranda state. The CICPC did not offer further details about the identity of the victim.
> 
> Detectives investigated and obtained evidence that linked José Berroterán, 43, to the crime. 
> 
> According to Rico, Berroterán had a debt with the victim that he refused to pay with various excuses. 
> 
> The accused was arrested by Polimiranda days after the crime for drug possession. CICPC officials later added evidence to his case that links him to the crime of Rada Hernández.
> 
> The investigations showed that Berroterán planned the murder, summoned the victim to the scene of the crime and when he met him, he began to beat her, stabbed her several times and then suffocated her with a plastic bag. 
> 
> The case was left in the hands of the Public Ministry to continue with the process.
> 
> Various organizations that defend the rights of the LGBTIQ+ population in Venezuela have denounced the acts of violence against this community. 
> 
> The Venezuelan Human Rights Action Education Program (Provea) has reiterated on different occasions that the LGBTIQ+ community in Venezuela does not have guarantees when it comes to legal aspects. 
> 
> “Venezuela continues to lag behind in terms of LGBTIQ+ rights compared to other Latin American countries,” the NGO said through its social networks.
> 
> In addition, Provea recognized the work of activists and associations that fight for equal rights in Venezuela, and urged citizens and the State to promote a society with more education and respect. However, for many, the efforts have not been enough. 
> 
> In November 2023, activists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) reported the murder of two transgender women within 48 hours.
> 
> Community representatives asked the authorities to guarantee investigations with a gender perspective, as well as protection for this group.
> 
> The reported cases occurred on November 10 and 12, the LGBTIQ+ Violence Observatory reported that the body of a trans woman was found in Caracas with 40 stab wounds, while another victim was killed by a beating, in Maracay, Aragua state.
