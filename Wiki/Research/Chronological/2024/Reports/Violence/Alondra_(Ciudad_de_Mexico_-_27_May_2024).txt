> MEXICO CITY.- Upon arriving at the house in Iztacalco, Gabriela found her two brothers and a trans woman, the girlfriend of one of them, dead. The victims were drinking alcohol inside the Iztacalco home when they were shot.
> 
> Like every day at 5:30 in the morning, the woman arrived at her family's house to open the store where she works in the Gabriel Ramos Millán neighborhood.
> 
> But to open the bakery curtain you must first enter the house and  thus reach the premises. 
> 
> She did so, but when she arrived at the living room of house number 2510 on 109 South Street, the woman found one of her brothers bloodied and sitting in an armchair in the living room.
> 
> When looking for his other brother in one of the bedrooms, he found him dead as well as his girlfriend.
> 
> Alerted by the discovery, the woman asked for help from police and paramedics to come to the scene to help the three people.
> 
> Upon arrival, paramedics only reported that the three had died from gunshot wounds.
> 
> Before the agents who attended the case, the woman said she did not know the causes of her brothers' death.
> 
> One of them was called Ricardo and a month ago he left the prison where he was locked up for causing injuries to a man who was drinking with him.
> 
> Alondra was Ricardo's trans woman girlfriend, and she had an aesthetic on the streets of the same mayor's office.
> 
> Gustavo was another of the brothers who, like Ricardo, worked as a mechanic in a verification center of the mayor's office. 
> 
> The two men and the woman were known by the inhabitants of the colony who described them as hard-working men but with the addiction of alcohol that kept them in constant fights.
> 
> The agents did not find the locks broken but they did find bottles of alcohol. That is why they think that the brothers were drinking with their attackers who, after committing the triple homicide, fled the scene.
