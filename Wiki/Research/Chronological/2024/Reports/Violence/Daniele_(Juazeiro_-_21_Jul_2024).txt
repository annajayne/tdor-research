> Transvestite stabbed to death in Juazeiro was facing several criminal proceedings
> Family members of the transvestite stabbed to death this Sunday (21) are still resolving pending issues for the release of the body by Pefoce. The woman is manicurist Porfiro Raimundo Diego da Silva, 21, whose real name is Daniele, who lived on Travessa Dr. Francisco Monteiro (Triângulo) in Juazeiro. She was facing charges for drug trafficking, theft, contempt, two robberies and a history of electronic monitoring violations. She had also been the victim of a shooting attack.
> 
> The murder took place at around 7:30 am on Sunday when he was using drugs with José Weliton Barbosa Silva, 25, known as “Brainha,” who lived on Rua Rui Barbosa (Santa Tereza). There was an argument that escalated into a conflict with a sharp weapon, with both men injured in the so-called Gaza Strip. Daniele died at the intersection of José Morocco and São Damião streets, while “Brainha” was taken to the HRC, where he died. He was wearing an ankle bracelet and was charged with assault, theft, bodily harm, receiving stolen goods, and drug trafficking.
> 
> One of Daniele's arrests was on July 24, 2021, when she was only 18 years old. By threatening him with a knife, she took a driver's cell phone and R$50.00. In addition, she threatened two Municipal Guards who were at the bus station and arrested her. Daniele had apparently rented the car in Crato to leave in Juazeiro, but, in front of the police officer, she said that she had arranged a sexual service for R$40.00 inside the vehicle and that they were going to exchange the money when she argued with the driver at the bus station.






> Young man who stabbed transvestite to death in Juazeiro and was killed committed his first robbery at the age of 14
> The body of the transvestite stabbed to death in Juazeiro, who killed the killer in a knife fight, remains at PEFOCE due to documentation. She was identified only as “Diego” or “Frozen” and was being investigated for robbery. The crimes took place at 7:30 am this Sunday at the corner of São Damião and José Morocco streets in Gaza Strip (Santa Tereza). The two were using drugs and argued, leading to the armed conflict in which the transvestite died at the scene and the killer at the Cariri Regional Hospital.
> 
> He was identified as José Weliton Barbosa Silva, 25 years old, nicknamed “Brainha” who lived on Rui Barbosa Street in that neighborhood. He wore an electronic ankle bracelet and was facing several charges for crimes of assault, theft, bodily harm, receiving stolen goods and drug trafficking. On May 30, 2013, he was only 14 years old when he committed a robbery with an accomplice at a traffic light on Avenida Padre Cícero (Antonio Vieira), taking a young man's motorcycle and cell phone.
> 
> On April 20, 2015, he was 16 years old when he and “SpongeBob” were taken to the police station with a stolen motorcycle. In the early hours of April 8, 2018, near the 2nd BPM, he and two others took the bag of a man who was drinking soup at a nearby snack bar. On March 23, 2021, in Vila Dom Bosco (Santa Tereza), he was arrested again in flagrante delicto with 118 rocks of crack packed in plastic bags.
