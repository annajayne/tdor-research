> Enquiry via https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/pages/contact from: Benny Ilac (maria.s.ilac@gmail.com) Organisation: His name was Rick Alastor Newman (he/him) and he was a trans man who lived in Bozeman, MT, USA and was shot and murdered by the police. Much of the news coverage (ex. https://www.facebook.com/kxlhtv/posts/sheriffcoroner-has-identified-rick-alastor-newman-as-the-person-who-died-details/1055719919836265/) around his death misgenders and/or deadnames him. He is greatly missed by his Montanan trans community. He was an artist, storyteller, and brother. He was excited to have just started hiking and camping and was looking forward to continue getting tattoos. In his passing, he joins his father, who he loved dearly.

> 
> [He] was found by police two hours later in the parking lot of the shopping complex located on the northeast corner of West Oak Street and North 19th Avenue.
> 
> According to the release, Newman was still "visibly in possession" of the handgun. Officers attempted to de-escalate the situation for nearly three hours.
> 
> Newman reportedly put the gun down around 1:45 a.m. and appeared to be giving up, but then grabbed the handgun again.
> 
> "Officers responded to the threat and fired several rounds, with the [male] succumbing to [his] injuries," according to a news release.
> 
> No officers were injured in the incident, and the involved officers have been placed on administrative leave per department policy; their names have not yet been released.
> 
> “First, our most heartfelt condolences go out to the family members and all who are impacted by this loss,” Chief Jim Veltkamp stated in the release. “Events like these affect our entire community. We are committed to a thorough investigation of this incident and appreciate everyone’s patience as we learn more.”
