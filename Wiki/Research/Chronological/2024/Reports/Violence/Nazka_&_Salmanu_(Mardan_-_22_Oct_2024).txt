> 
> Two transgender persons have been brutally murdered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s district of Mardan, raising the murder toll from the community in the province to 10 this year.
> 
> According to the first information registered with Mardan police, three unidentified assailants came to the house of the transgender persons and attacked occupants with sharp-edged weapons. The assailants stabbed to death transgender Sabir alias Nazka and Salman alias Salmanu and fled the scene. Another occupant Arshad alias Shawki saved himself by hiding in the bathroom.
> 
> The incident happened in an upper-storey house near the Police Lines locality in Mardan.  “One of the assailants first entered the house posing as a client saying he wanted to arrange a musical show with the transgenders,” Anmol Rani, a focal person of the transgender community told Voicepk.net on the phone from Mardan. Later, two other unidentified also barged into the house and started stabbing both transgender persons with sword-like weapons, she said, adding other occupants of the house hid themselves in the bathroom to save their lives.
> 
> A statement from Mardan police stated that District Police Officer Mardan Zahoor Babar Afridi had taken immediate notice of the gruesome double murder and directed officials to arrest the suspects swiftly. The slain transgender persons were laid to rest in the city on October 22.
> 
> Arzoo Khan, head of the transgender community in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Voicepk.net that the double murder has brought the toll of transgender persons killed in violence-related incidents to 10 this year. According to the database maintained by the transgender community, at least 140 transgender persons have been killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since 2015, she added. “This is just a senseless act of violence and yet another painful reminder of the extreme cruelty faced by the transgender community in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” she added.
> 
> Arzoo Khan urged the authorities to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice. The transgender persons are human beings and citizens of the state, the government has the responsibility to ensure their safety in society, she added.  “It’s time to stand up against this ongoing brutality and work towards ensuring the safety and dignity of every transgender person.”
> 
> Arzoo Khan, who is also the Executive Director of Manzil Foundation, said her foundation has also constituted a Vigilance Violence Group to raise awareness about assaults on the transgender community in the province. In a recent meeting with senior police officials, the members of the transgender community and activists called for the establishment of Tahafuz Centers in Peshawar, dedicated to providing safety and support for the transgender community.



> Three men are under arrest in Pakistan in connection with the stabbing murders of two transgender women. Police have obtained confessions from the suspects, who admitted they were part of a criminal gang targeting trans people, AAJ News reports.
> 
> The two women were slain with daggers at their home in Mardan, a city in the culturally conservative northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Sunday. A third transgender woman was present at the house during the killings but was able to hide and escape harm.
> 
> The three men were arrested Tuesday. Earlier today, the trio appeared at a press conference with district police chief Zahur Babar Afridi, handcuffed and wearing hoods to conceal their identities. Afridi told reporters the three men confessed to the murders, but that authorities were still investigating a potential motive for the crime.
> 
> Despite Afridi’s statement at the news conference that investigators are still looking for a motive, AAJ News reports that the trio confessed to being part of an organized crime gang that targeted transgender individuals.
> 
> The attacks highlight the danger faced by the transgender community in the Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan. Transgender people are often slain in so-called honor killings by relatives who feel the trans person has brought disgrace to their family by revealing their true gender identity.
