> On Friday, July 5, a 40-year-old man went to the Compiègne police station and reported killing his partner, a trans woman, with an axe. He was placed in pretrial detention and charged.
> 
> At the police station, the 40-year-old man confessed to the murder of his partner. According to his statements, an argument broke out between the couple and led him to grab a small ax and hit the victim.
> 
> The discovery of the body
> The latter's body was discovered on Friday, July 5, at the common home, located in Compiègne, " on the sixth floor of a building in the Maréchaux district" , according to our colleagues at the Courrier Picard. The Compiègne public prosecutor then went to the scene, as did the technical and scientific police service of Creil. A flagrante delicto investigation was opened by the Compiègne public prosecutor's office on July 5, and entrusted to the city's local judicial police service.
> 
> After the Compiègne public prosecutor's office was relinquished to the Senlis criminal division, the public prosecutor opened a judicial investigation on July 7, 2024, for murder by a partner against the 40-year-old man.
> 
> Transphobic act ruled out at this stage of the investigation
> Born male, the victim had begun a gender transition and had a female civil status. But according to the Senlis prosecutor's office, nothing " indicates that this element would have motivated a criminal act, at this stage of the investigation ." An investigation that should clarify the motives for the crime.
> 
> According to the Courrier Picard, the victim, " a former municipal agent, who had been a gym caretaker for the city of Compiègne, no longer worked ". His partner " allegedly lived by being and making ends meet ". They were both " under eviction orders ". The alleged perpetrator, already known to the courts, has a criminal record with several mentions, notably for financial offenses, but also for intentional violence dating back more than 10 years.
> 
> Presented to the investigating judge of Senlis, he was charged and placed in provisional detention in accordance with the prosecution's requests. He risks life imprisonment.
> 
> An autopsy of the victim, who was 55 years old, will be carried out this Monday, July 8, by a forensic doctor from the Creil medical-judicial unit, in order to clarify the circumstances of the death.



> In Compiègne, a woman killed with an ax by the man she was sheltering
> The alleged murderer, aged 40, turned himself in at the Compiègne police station on Friday, saying he had a violent argument with the victim. The circumstances of the tragedy and the links between the two protagonists remain unclear. The neighborhood, however, suggests a pair of outcasts.
> July 6, 2024 at 10:47 am
> The tragedy took place on the 6th floor of a building on rue de l'Amiral-Wemyss in Compiègne, in the Maréchaux district. LP/Hervé Sénamaud
> 
> In the building located at number 6 rue de l'Amiral-Wemyss in Compiègne , she called herself Angelina or Dadou but was born under the first name David. The body of this 55-year-old woman in transition was found, Friday mid-morning, covered in wounds in an apartment on the 6th floor.
> 
> A few minutes earlier, a 40-year-old man had come to the Compiègne police station to accuse himself of violence against the woman who lived there.
> 
> Fatal violence, since the police officers who arrived on the scene could only confirm his death, leaving the rest of the day to the forensic specialists, the time to carry out all the necessary observations in this type of situation.
> 
> The alleged murderer was immediately taken into custody as part of an investigation conducted by police officers from the Compiègne police station. The circumstances of the tragedy remain unknown for the moment, but the neighborhood describes a duo with a rather marginal lifestyle and a context of recurrent alcohol consumption.
> 
> “We had already filed petitions with the landlord, because of the noise and the presence of people not in the building,” said a neighbor. “Angelina used to open her door to anyone, there were homeless people who came there and refused to leave afterwards.”
> 
> Nuisances that did not make the victim extremely popular in the building. For about a year, she had been housing the alleged murderer. “A strange guy but rather calm,” remembers another resident. "I think he was under guardianship or curatorship. He sometimes visited in the street or near the shopping center."
> 
> “Once, he even ranks my doorbell to ask for a mobile phone,” says a neighbor. “I live upstairs and we often hear noise and arguments. I'm not that surprised that there was a tragedy, but I was more afraid of Angelina, who seemed more aggressive and violent than the man she was staying with. In any case, I didn't hear anything on Friday or the night before. I understood that something was happening when the police came to ring my doorbell to ask me if I had seen or heard anything.”
> 
> The victim had been living there for nearly twenty years. The links between Angelina and her alleged murderer remain questionable, she herself frequently indicated that "she did not have a romantic relationship" with the man she was hosting. A man known to the justice system and who also has a history of psychiatric problems. The Compiègne prosecutor's office is, for the moment, limiting itself to recalling that "an investigation is underway", without prejudging a possible context of femicide . The criminal division of the Senlis prosecutor's office should soon be seized of the case.
