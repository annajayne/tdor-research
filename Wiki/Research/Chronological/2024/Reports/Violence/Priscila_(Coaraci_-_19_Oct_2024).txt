> On Saturday night (19), a wave of homicides shocked the small towns of Coaraci and Ibicaraí, in southern Bahia. Three homicides were recorded, generating outrage and concern in local communities.
>
> The first crime occurred around 10 pm, in a bar located in Beira Rio 2. In the attack, two people were shot by hooded individuals who fired at least 20 shots. One of the victims, identified so far as Bia, died instantly.
>
> The other, Priscila, a trans woman, was rescued by SAMU to the General Hospital of Coaraci, but unfortunately she did not survive her injuries and died in the hospital.
>
> Authorities are investigating the details of the case, which stands out not only for its brutality but also for the pattern that seems to be repeating itself: other deaths have occurred in the city recently, many with the same modus operandi. So far, it is not known whether the victims had any connection to the criminal world.
>
> At the same time, in Ibicaraí, another similar crime was recorded, when a woman identified by her first name Adriana was shot dead inside the Por do Sol bar. Reports indicate that Adriana was accompanied by her husband during the attack.
> 
> Armed men arrived and shot the victim, who fell to the ground dead. Adriana's partner, in an unexpected act, got into a car and left the scene immediately after the incident.
