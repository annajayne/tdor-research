> 
> When the emergency services arrived, they were able to confirm that both people were on the ground, half naked, and there was blood; a transgender woman had died and had injuries to her head and face; the man was lying on the side with a wound to the chest, but did not require transfer to the hospital.
> 
> Municipal police officers also arrived and cordoned off the area and arrested the man as a suspected suspect. Later, in his first statements, he said that “some voices inside him” told him to kill his partner.

> 
> The mother of the arrested man said that she was the one who called 911 because she heard the alleged argument about two hours earlier. After silence returned, she approached the place where her son and his partner, originally from Mexico City, were and discovered the scene.
> 
> The intentional homicide group of the State Attorney General's Office (FGJ) carried out the protocols for the removal of the body and the collection of evidence to integrate them into the investigation file, while the alleged perpetrator was placed at the disposal of the authorities, who will define his legal situation.
