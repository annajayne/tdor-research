> 
> Nuevo León has recorded at least four transfemicides so far this year, according to figures provided by LGBT community groups. 
> 
> One of the most recent cases is that of Arantza Aldanelly Castillo Cruz, a 23-year-old trans woman who disappeared on July 7 in the Nueva Conquista neighborhood of Monterrey . On July 26, Arantza's lifeless body was found , and after genetic tests carried out by the State Attorney General's Office, his identity was confirmed the following Monday. 
> 
> Arantza, described by friends and family as a cheerful, outgoing young woman who loved to dance, had actively collaborated in the campaign of the senator-elect for Morena, Judith Díaz.
> 
> In addition to the Arantza case, other incidents have shaken the region. On July 7, two charred bodies were found in a house in Monterre, one of them decapitated. One of the victims, identified as Alisson, approximately 35 years old, was a trans woman, about whom there is no further information. 
> 
> Also in Guadalupe, Nuevo León, a trans person was found dead in the shower of a motel room, with signs of strangulation. The establishment's staff realized when they went to inform them that the rental period had already ended, but no one responded. However, upon hearing the shower running, they decided to go get a copy of the key and upon entering the room they found the body in the bathroom with a towel wrapped around its neck.
> 
> Jaqueline, “La Española,” is another victim . She was known for her contribution to the Colectivo Trans Monterrey and the “Sexy Doll” program. For more than a decade, she worked in the prevention of HIV and other STIs, and was a fundamental voice in education and awareness about the rights of trans people. 
> 
> Activist Silvia Sofía, from the Colectivo Trans Monterrey, has announced her intention to promote a legislative initiative in Congress with the new administration to classify the murders of trans women as transfemicides or feminicides due to transphobia. 
> 
> "We are going to seek to have the new legislature that comes from the new Congress introduce a bill to classify femicides or rather to classify murders of trans women as transfemicides or femicides due to transphobia," she mentioned.
> 
> In an alarming context of four transfemicides recorded in Nuevo León and a total of 36 nationwide, Silvia Sofía emphasized the urgency of this measure to confront the growing violence against the trans community in Mexico. The activist emphasizes that, being a minority population, these crimes show a worrying trend that requires a strong and effective legal response.
> 
>  "There are already four here in the state, in Nuevo León, in Monterrey, and there are 36 trans femicides in the country. This already puts us on alert because in Mexico we are a minority population of trans women and there are already four in Monterrey and 36 around the country. It is a significant sum that puts us on alert that trans women are also being murdered," she concluded.
