> 
> A transvestite identified as Monalisa was killed this Wednesday (11), in the Center of Fortaleza, at the intersection of Bárbara de Alencar and Rodrigues Júnior streets. The Military Police of Ceará (PMCE) was called after reports of shots fired in public and, upon arriving at the scene, found the victim already dead.
> 
> Monalisa, known to local residents, was a frequent presence in the region and had lived in the city center for a long time, according to reports from residents. The crime was allegedly committed by a man on a bicycle who approached the victim and fired several shots, without any apparent argument before the attack. She died at the scene before the Mobile Emergency Care Service (SAMU) arrived.
> 
> Teams from the 5th Military Police Battalion isolated the area to preserve the crime scene and began investigations.
> 
> So far, authorities are working on the hypothesis that the homicide may be related to a possible feud between groups operating in the central region of Fortaleza. It is not known, however, whether the perpetrator was known to the victim.
> 
> The case will be investigated in detail by the Civil Police of the State of Ceará (PCCE), which continues to collect information to try to identify the perpetrator of the crime.
> 
> The public can contribute to investigations by providing information that will help police work. Information can be directed to the number 181, the Disque-Denúncia of the Secretariat of Public Security and Social Defense (SSPDS), or to (85) 3101-0181, which is the WhatsApp number through which reports can be made via message, audio, video and photography or even via “e-denúncias”, the website of the 181 service, through the electronic address: https://disquedenuncia181.sspds.ce.gov.br/.
