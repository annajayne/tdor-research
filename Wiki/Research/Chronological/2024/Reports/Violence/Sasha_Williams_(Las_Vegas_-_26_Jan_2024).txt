> On January 26 2024 Sasha Williams Dunn Marië Sasha @got_kitty was murdered in Las Vegas. Regardless of the false narratives and fake news some people in the community have created the reason is still unknown yet the suspect was arrested. Anyone that knows me knows this was my baby sis, one of my best friends and my heart. I haven’t been able to process this loss and I think about her beautiful energy everyday. She was so much to so many and too much for this cold world. I’m a firm believer that to be absent from the body is to be eternally present in the spiritual realm of peace and prosperity and I feel her lifting me up everyday, telling me to chill when I’m ready to go left! Her family will be honoring her memory in Raleigh,North Carolina on February 24 2024. If you are able to contribute or send flowers please feel free to do so (flyer attached )
