> The disappearance of 21-year-old transgender woman Simi from her home in Perumbakkam, Chennai, has ended in a grim discovery. Simi, who resided with her parents in a Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board house, vanished without a trace on 25 January 2024, leaving her family in distress. Despite their desperate attempts to reach her via cellphone, all efforts were futile as her phone remained switched off.
> 
> The anguish of Simi’s family culminated in a missing person report filed at the Perumbakkam Police Station. However, the search for Simi took a tragic turn when her lifeless body was found on the OMR Chemmanjeri Road on 28 January 2024.
> 
> On 3 February 2024, a significant breakthrough occurred when police apprehended five transgender women involved in the illegal sale of marijuana. As investigators delved deeper into the backgrounds of the detained individuals, a chilling revelation emerged as these very individuals were responsible for Simi’s untimely demise.
> 
> Further scrutiny into the circumstances surrounding Simi’s death uncovered a disturbing network of illicit activities, including prostitution. It came to know that, in Siruseri, OMR regions, the transgender women who got arrested, and identified as Anandhi, Aparna, Abi, Rathi including the dead simi were involved in prostitution.
> 
> Reports suggest that Simi’s popularity among young individuals in the Sirucheri and OMR regions may have fuelled jealousy and resentment among her peers, ultimately leading to her tragic murder.
