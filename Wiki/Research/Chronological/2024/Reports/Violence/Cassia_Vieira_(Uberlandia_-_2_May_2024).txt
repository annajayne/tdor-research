She died from injuries caused by a piercing instrument in Bairro Martins, in Uberlândia, on Thursday (2). According to family members, the victim was a reserved woman.
>
> Cássia worked as a hairdresser and provided home care for people from the city's high society. In the relationship, her ex-boyfriend spent days at her house and even left clothes at the property. To her family, Cássia said that the relationship between them was good. However, friends said that they advised her to end the relationship on several occasions due to the fights and attacks.
>
> The victim also constantly lent money to the suspect and bought things for him. His debt to the victim reached R$1,500, which Cássia asked him to pay.

"I don't think he killed her just because of the debt. There's a lot of anger involved. If he was going there just to talk, why did he take a knife? I even think he has some prejudice because she's a trans woman, the relationship theirs was only inside the house", said the niece.
