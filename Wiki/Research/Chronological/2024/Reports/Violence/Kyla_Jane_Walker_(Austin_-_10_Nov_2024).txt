> My beautiful sister Kyla Jane Walker was hit by a vehicle and killed in a hit and run in Austin, TX 11/10/2024. Her murderer, Aldair Albiter-Casas was arrested 1/17/25. 



> My beautiful sister was struck by a vehicle and killed in a hit and run in Austin, TX on Sunday. When she transistioned, she was ostracized by everyone in our religious family. But not me, she became mine. 
> 
> She was the most brilliant human I've ever encountered a fierce advocate for the weird and wonderful that made up her found family. I'm utterly devastated and she leaves a hole in my heart that will never be filled.
> 
> I have fought tooth and nail to respect her wishes and honor her legacy against my mother who abandoned her 10 years ago. She will be cremated and placed into a tree urn that will hopefully one day grow in my back yard for my children who adored her to climb. 
> 
> I'm not sure what I'm trying to do with this. I love this group and the acceptance and love her and she deserves to have her memory flung far and wide. 
> 
> She mattered. And she mattered to me.
> 
> Thank you all. Her last words on her final social media post were this:
> 
> "Resist Despair"
> 
> Love you Forever Kyla Walker

> Kyla Jane Walker (January 10,1985 - November 10,2024)
> 
> **UPDATE**
> 
> Y'all have me crying at work I was not expecting this.
> 
> Not a single member of my family offered condolences, sent flowers, or offered money for her funeral. My wife and I worked tirelessly to honor her wishes and both her death certificate and cremation certificate use her legal name Kyla Jane Walker and are addressed to me as I claimed her in death the same way I did in life. 
> 
> We made the crash site a memorial to honor her. Her found family gifted me two of her guitars that now sit in my music room (our shared passion). My wife and I got tattoos of her handwriting that she wrote in our wedding book. I got a tattoo that she had on her neck on my leg in the trans colors. We celebrated her 40th birthday party January 10 with her ashes in a dark humor way that she would have absolutely loved (we put a party hat and googly eyes on her ashes) and then a week later, her murderer was arrested thanks in part to the massive amount of work my wife did bc she was not satisfied with APD's response. He is currently in jail charged with 4 felonies awaiting his court date.
> 
> Words will never express what your kind words have meant to me. In my darkest hour, I reached out to the Internet for kindness because my family failed me. They answered then, and 3 months later, y'all have answered today
> 
> Resist Despair Always. For Kyla.
