> Paris, France; April 03, 2024: JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) expresses deep concern over the brutal murder of Reshma Khatun (25), a third-gender individual, whose decomposed body was discovered in March 2024 in the Kagajpukur graveyard of Benapole Port Police Station in Jessore, Bangladesh.
> 
> The France-based rights organization calls for the swift identification and apprehension of those responsible for this heinous act through a prompt, impartial, and transparent investigation, followed by exemplary punishment after a fair trial.
> 
> According to news published in various newspapers in Bangladesh, it has been learned that the police recovered the decomposed body of Reshma Khatun (25), a third gender individual, from the Kagajpukur graveyard of Benapole Port Police Station in Jessore.
> 
> Reshma's body was recovered in a joint operation by the Jessore District Detective Branch (DB) and Benapole Port Police Station on Monday afternoon, March 11, 2024. Reshma Khatun is the daughter of the deceased Zakir Hossain from Rajbari village of Kagazpukur under Benapole police station, Jessore.
> 
> It is noteworthy that for the past few days, there had been reports of Reshma (a Hijra, or third gender person) from Benapole's Kagazpukur village going missing. Locals informed the Benapole Port Police Station on the morning of March 11, Monday, when they noticed fresh soil being dug inside the cemetery.
> 
> Later, with the assistance of local residents and the police station, the Jessore Detective Branch (DB) police team excavated the soil of the cemetery and recovered the partially decomposed body of Reshma Khatun.
> 
> Previously, a young man named Farukh Hossain (25) was arrested for his involvement in the murder, and the police team located Reshma based on his confession. The detained Farooq Hossain is the son of Noor Islam from the same village.
> 
> Farooq Hossain informed the police that Reshma was slain with a knife, her hands and feet bound, in the orchard of the deceased Sirajul Islam in Kagazpukur village on March 08, 2024. Subsequently, her body was buried in the mentioned location in the cemetery.
> 
> It is initially known that 5-6 other individuals, including Farooq, are involved in the murder of Reshma. After the murder, the perpetrators attempted to dispose of some of Reshma's clothes, two mobile phones, and other evidence by concealing them in various locations.
> 
> The concerned authorities conducted an autopsy on Reshma's decomposed dead body, and a murder case has been filed with the Benapole Port Police Station, Jessore.
> 
> Advocate Shahanur Islam, the Founder and President of JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF), urges the authorities in Bangladesh to prioritize this case and promptly apprehend all the culprits involved. He emphasizes the importance of ensuring the safety and protection of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation.
> 
> JMBF highlights that Reshma Khatun, who identified as a transgender Hijra, represents a marginalized and often vulnerable community in Bangladeshi society. The circumstances surrounding her murder, which occurred at her residence due to her involvement with transgender communities, are deeply troubling and raise significant questions about the safety and security of transgender individuals in Bangladesh.
> 
> Furthermore, JMBF points out that the murder of Reshma Khatun is not an isolated incident but rather a common part of the ongoing violation and discrimination perpetuated against LGBTQI people in Bangladesh. They believe that many incidents of violence against LGBT individuals go unreported due to social unacceptability in Bangladesh.
>
> JMBF calls upon Bangladeshi authorities to guarantee the rights and protection of LGBT people in Bangladesh by enacting the Protection of Sexual Minority People Act after repealing Section 377 of the Bangladesh Penal Code as soon as possible.
