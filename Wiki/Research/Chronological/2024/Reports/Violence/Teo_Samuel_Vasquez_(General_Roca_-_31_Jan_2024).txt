The autopsy indicated that Vázquez died of "congestion and bilateral pulmonary edema of undetermined cause."

> Meanwhile, and given that the Prosecutor's Office decided to investigate the cause as a femicide , the police official confided that the young man who was found next to the victim (both 19 years old) with apparent signs of strangulation, was discharged, to then be taken to a police station, as a detainee until the facts are clarified.
> 
> In this context, the data revealed by the autopsy on the young man's body will be decisive, a study that will be carried out this Thursday.
