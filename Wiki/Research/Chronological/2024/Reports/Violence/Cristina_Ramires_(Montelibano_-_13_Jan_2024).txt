> Tonight we received the painful and regrettable news that Cristina Ramírez, an intersex woman in her late 40s, was murdered in the municipality of Montelíbano, located south of Córdoba. According to preliminary information from witnesses, the woman was violently approached in her home, where armed subjects shot her four times, causing her death. At the time this statement was published, people close to the victim assure that there were no known threats against her. Cristina, who was also popularly known as 'María bonita', was dedicated to the production and sale of indigenous fabrics, for which she was known and appreciated in the municipality. 
> 
> This heartbreaking event has increased the perception of insecurity among LGBTIQ+ citizens in the municipality, as it occurs in the context of other acts of violence that have occurred against people with diverse sexual orientations, identities and/or gender expressions in Montelíbano during the last months of 2023 and the beginning of this year. This also refers to the violent death of Daniel Preciado, a 24-year-old gay man from the municipality, which occurred on December 29. His body was found in front of the Montelíbano Ecological Park. 
> 
> This situation has motivated LGBTIQ+ people and the Montelibanese community to urgently call for the installation of a security council to prevent and investigate the different types of violence that are occurring in the municipality and that, consequently, are differentially affecting LGBTIQ+ people, as they are a historically excluded and vulnerable group in that subregion and in the rest of the country.
