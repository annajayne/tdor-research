> Huber Blanco Medina, 27, is the first trans woman murdered in Cartagena so far in 2024. The crime occurred on the morning of last Thursday, July 11, when hitmen shot her in the Las Tablitas sector of the Santa Ana district, Baru.
> 
> They took her to a medical center, but she arrived without vital signs and, now, the authorities are looking for those responsible and trying to establish the motives.
> 
> The Metropolitan Police reported that the victim was talking to a subject, who pulled out a firearm and shot him. He added that he had a judicial record as being accused of drug trafficking, and that during the technical inspection of her body he found a bag with hallucinogenic substances and cash.
> 
> In 2023, Dania Sarith Polo, a trans leader from El Carmen de Bolívar, died in a similar way. It happened in April and she was an active member of Caribe Afirmativo in that municipality.
