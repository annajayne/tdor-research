> LOS ANGELES – A trans woman found dead on a south Los Angeles street March 20th has been identified by her family.
> 
> Meraxes, 24, previously known as Gerardo Medina, was pronounced dead at the scene when discovered by authorities.
> 
> According to a GoFundMe established to assist her family, “a car was seen fleeing the area and surveillance camera video from a sports bar across the street, captured a light-colored sedan, with its lights off next to the parking lot of a high school.”
> 
> “At some point, a figure emerges and appears to drag her body onto the pavement before getting back into the car and driving off. She was laying there lifeless for several minutes in view of passing motorists before police even arrived on scene she didn’t deserve what happened to her. Way to many trans lives are being taken everyday and it’s not ok if you can help in anyways possible it is more than greatly appreciated.”
