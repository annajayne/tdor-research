Known as “Chevy” and “TK” to loved ones, Hill was the owner of Evollusion, a salon where he sought “to create a haven where the barbershop experience transcended into a space of safety and affirmation for young black queer individuals,” according to the Atlanta-based Black trans advocacy organization Solutions Not Punishment Collaborative (SnapCo). The salon posted to Facebook on March 3 to inform people that Hill had passed, writing, “The kind words and shared memories makes our hearts smile and eases the pain. We know the awesome person Righteous was, but seeing the place he holds in you guys heart brings some joy to our difficult days.”
> 
> Model and activist Yves Mathieu posted to Instagram on Tuesday to pay tribute to Hill and provide details about his life. “growing up as young black queer boys/kids, the barbershop experience can sometimes be a tricky space to occupy, this was something that Chevy understood and wanted to cultivate a space of safety where you can also get the affirming look and style you want, and he did exactly that,” Mathieu wrote.
> 
> SnapCo posted to Instagram on Thursday, sharing the details of Hill’s homegoing service and calling him “a soul who radiated love and light.”
> 
> In a statement to Them, SnapCo executive director Toni Michelle said that while the details of Hill’s murder remain unknown, “we are holding space for us, his friends, and chosen family in Atlanta as we grieve.”
> 
> “Gun violence is plaguing our community and anti-trans rhetoric and legislation fuels the violence that Black and trans people face each day,” she said. “We pray that justice for Chevy, as well as the people who knew and cherished him the most, will be served in our lifetime. We must pledge to protect one another, and practice that commitment.”
> 
> Michelle concluded her statement by asking people to sign onto SnapCo’s pledge to protect Black people and trans people.

> 
> “AS I LAY IN THIS TENT I REALIZE IMMEDIATELY camping is relaxing and I’M NOT the same as I used to be. I’m grown now. I try my best to avoid things taking me back to the old me. MOST importantly I’m still working on myself. Letting people feel like they’ve “won” has helped me drastically [reduce] ignorance and drama in my life! AMAZINGLY I now have time and cognitive focus on my FOCUS! Point is I’m a mature, happy adult & I thank God for the growth.”

> Righteous Torrence Hill, known by his loved ones as “TK” , will forever be remembered as one who fostered a loving, caring environment and served as an empowering light for others.
