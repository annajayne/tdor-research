> Pauly Likens, 14, went missing from her home in Sharon, PA on June 22, 2024. She was reported missing on June 25, 2024 the same day her body parts started being found at the Shenango River Reservoir. A 29 year old man has been arrested.





> Pauly Likens Was a 14 Year Old Trans Girl When She Was Brutally Murdered in Sharon, PA

> Pauly Likens
> Pauly Likens was a 14 year old trans girl, born and raised in Sharon, Pennsylvania. She went missing on June 22, 2024. Pauly was killed on June 23, 2024. Her parents reported her missing on June 25, 2024. Her death by murder was announced on July3, 2024.
> 
> The Crime
> From The Sharon Herald
> 
> Likens was reported missing to the Sharon Police Department at about 2:30 p.m. June 25. Later that evening, the Hermitage Police Department responded to a report of dismembered human remains being found near the Golden Run Wildlife Area at the lake, near Clark.
> 
> The investigation was referred to the state police. Over the course of the next week, more dismembered human remains were discovered in multiple areas surrounding the lake, according to a press release from the state police barracks in Mercer.
> 
> The state police were also seen using an underwater drone to search the Shenango River near the Budd Street bridge in downtown Sharon on June 27.
> 
> Sharon Herald
> On Wednesday, July 3, police confirmed that these remains belonged to Pauly, notified her family, and arrested DaShawn Watkins, 29, of Sharon. Watkins was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated assault, abuse of a corpse and tampering with physical evidence, according to court documents. He was arraigned and is being held without bail in the Mercer County Jail.
> 
> Note that law enforcement and many media outlets misgender Pauly, in some cases using her deadname. Her chosen name was a derivative of her birth name. I have reached out and asked GLAAD to do so. The Sharon Herald’s reporting is the most accurate I can find. I urge you to link to their site. They are at the epicenter of this story.
> 
> Honoring Pauly Likens
> According to sources, Pauly had been in the local public school. In 2023, she transferred to schooling at home. She’s described as someone who always had her nails done. Sometimes she used the name Paula.
> 
> She had blue eyes, dark blond hair, and often wearing Converse sneakers. Pauly was known for her trademark beanie hat.
> 
> Her social media content indicates that she liked dogs and other animals. She followed several pages dedicating to doing community works. Her family shared photos of her from a Dave Matthews Concert.
> 
> The Shenango Valley Pride Picnic and LGBTQIA+ Alliance Support Groups will hold a candlelight vigil on Saturday, July 13, 2024 in Sharon.
> 
> 
> The Context
> My list includes 23 individuals whose deaths were discovered this year. This number is likely not complete as there are multiple reports that have yet to be confirmed.
> 
> At age 14, Pauly is the youngest person on this list and possibly the youngest person I’ve ever memorialized. There are five trans teens total on this list so far. In 2023, we reported the deaths of two teenagers.
> 
> Pauly’s death is an eerie echo of the 2023 murder of Jacob Williamson, 18, in North Carolina. Like Pauly, Jacob reportedly met his murderer online or through a dating app. Jacob also disappeared in late June 2023 and was found in early July. Jacob’s killers held him captive and brutally murdered him.
> 
> The autopsy reveals his cause of death was multiple sharp force injuries. The report shared details of more than 30 stab wounds, cuts and mutilations. Some body parts were intentionally removed. His body was placed into multiple trash bags.
> 
> There is a trend I’ve noticed and reported on before
> 
> The deaths are not literally connected. They are connected to a narrative that has ratcheted upwards in recent years. A narrative of erasing trans experiences. And erasing trans people through policies and procedures in schools, in local and state legislation, and national rhetoric. A narrative that demonizes trans youth for simply existing.
> 
> If we continue to turn away from the complex realities of trans youth in our society, we are taking a significant risk that it will get worse. We need to consider this context of age in these conversations. Broad generalizations about younger generations attitudes towards identity may be overlooking a very real threat.
> 
> More trans youth are being killed and their murderers are increasingly younger. In Pauly’s case, a 29 year old plucked a 14 year old into meeting him. Dating app? Maybe. But what was going on in her life and in her mind that led her to make that terrible decision to meet him? Obviously, I’m not saying she did this to herself, I’m saying that we have to ask ourselves tougher questions about the reality we create for trans teens.
> 
> Sharon is located in Mercer County in Northwestern Pennsylvania. It is about halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh. It is home to Grove City College, one of the most notorious rightwing schools in the nation. However, it is also home to multiple school districts that have been on the cutting edge of inclusive and affirming policies for LGBTQ youth. I’ll explore this in a future post.
> 
> Rest in power, Pauly. You deserved to grow up. Your life was precious in all its complexity and unique design. Your family came looking for you, they were relentless in their determination to find you. They loved you. It is hard to tell a 14 year old to rest in their death. Know that your LGBTQ neighbors will honor your life and respond to your death by reaching out more firmly to other trans, nonbinary, and GNC youth in Mercer County.

> Man charged with killing, dismembering missing 14-year-old in Mercer County, police say – WPXI
> MERCER COUNTY, Pa. — A man is facing charges in connection to human remains found in a Mercer County lake at the end of June.
> 
> In a news release, Pennsylvania State Police says dismembered human remains were found partially in the water of Shenango Lake on June 25. More dismembered remains were found in Shenango Lake and “various” remote locations over the next week, and the coroner determined they all belonged to the same person.
> 
> PSP says the victim is a 14-year-old, Paul Likens Jr. He was reported missing from Sharon on June 25.
> 
> PSP says a forensic pathologist determined Paul was dismembered by “some type of cutting instrument.” The Mercer County Coroner’s Office ruled his cause of death as sharp force trauma to the head and the manner of death as homicide.
> 
> The last known contact with Paul was on June 22, according to PSP. While looking into phone records, social media records and surveillance video, police learned the teen walked to Budd Street Public Park and Canoe Launch on June 23 around 3 a.m. He appeared to be on the phone and waiting to meet someone.
> 
> Police also used video footage during the time Paul was at the launch area to develop a suspect vehicle, which they say returned to Riverwalk Apartments. Court documents clarify police tracked a vehicle that enters and exits the canoe launch around the last time Paul’s phone pinged with area cell towers.
> 
> Riverwalk Apartment video showed a man, identified as DaShawn Watkins, 2, leaving and returning to his apartment in a way that police say is consistent with the suspect vehicle movement. When the man returns, he is struggling to carry a duffle bag. The video also showed Watkins leave his apartment several times on June 24 carrying “multiple bags and garbage bags.”
> 
> PSP says preliminary tests were positive for blood in Watkin’s apartment, including under the bathroom floor lining.
> 
> According to court documents, Watkins says he met up with someone he met on a dating app the night Paul was killed, but didn’t think he stopped at the canoe launch area and said the person he met with didn’t come back to his apartment. He claimed the bag he was carrying was luggage from a vacation that he had left in his car.
> 
> Watkins is facing several charges, including murder in the first degree and abuse of a corpse. He’s being held in the Mercer County Jail without bail.
