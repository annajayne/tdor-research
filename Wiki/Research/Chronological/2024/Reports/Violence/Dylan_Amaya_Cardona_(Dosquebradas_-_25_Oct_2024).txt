> CTI investigators have a big task to clarify the murder of Dylan Amaya Cardona, formerly known as Yuly, 33 years old, who was found in the waters of the Otún River yesterday morning after being missing for several days. This is how it happened Around 9:30 in the morning, the residents of the La Esneda neighborhood saw something strange that was stuck between the rocks, it was a body, so they called the Metropolitan Police units. Without knowing that they were facing a homicide, they went to the site and asked for the support of both the Technical Investigation Corps and the Official Fire Department of the city. With ropes and anchor points, the rescuers brought Dylan's body to the shore where the criminalistics units managed to do the technical inspection of the corpse and discovered that he had several stab wounds in the head, neck and back. The body was taken to the headquarters of Forensic Medicine where today the remains will be delivered to the family to say their last goodbye, while they wait almost a month for the official verdict by the forensic doctors. What happened to him? According to what was learned, the victim's family reported him missing since the previous night, when he left his house in the Japan neighborhood at 11:00 pm to go on a motorcycle taxi ride and did not return; the event was strange and they feared that something bad had happened to him. Fact One of the mysteries is what time the events took place, since when he was taken out of the water, the body was still bleeding from the wounds.
