> Extortion could be the motive behind the attack that left a trans woman dead in Los Olivos
> Valeska London, as the victim identified herself, was fatally shot in the head. The Costeños structure and alias 'Carlos Muleta' are believed to be behind the attack.
> 
> Authorities have released new details about the criminal attack that occurred at 9:30 pm on Wednesday, September 4, in the Los Olivos II neighborhood , which left a trans woman dead and an informal security guard injured .
> 
> Early in the morning, information had emerged about the attack that took place in front of a business on Carrera 27 and Calle 111, where the victims Luis Javier Villegas Puerta , 32, and Levis Enrique Chacin Sequera , 19, were.
> 
> In that first version, witnesses told the authorities that the victims were standing outside a liquor store when the criminal was passed by and shot repeatedly.
> 
> Villegas Puerta, who identified herself as Valeska London and belonged to the LGBTIQ community , died as a result of the shooting. Meanwhile, Chacin Sequera, an informal security guard, was injured and had to be transferred to the La Manga neighborhood hospital .
> 
> Regarding the motives for this incident, judicial sources indicated that the attack was based on the collection of extortion from the owners of the business where the victims were staying, as a method of pressure so that they would pay a sum close to 10 million pesos .
> 
> The line of investigation also points to a subject known as alias Carlos Muleta , a zone chief of 'los Costeños' who would receive direct orders from alias Castor .
> 
> This same subject, according to judicial sources, would be the same one who ordered the murder of Ener Claudina Núñez the previous week , which occurred inside a house in the La Paz neighborhood .
> 
> The NGO Caribe Afirmativo published a statement expressing its “deep pain and indignation” over the death of Valeska London.
> 
> “This tragic event adds to a growing wave of systematic violence against trans people in Colombia that, so far in 2024, has claimed the lives of at least 31 LGBTIQ+ people, of whom 16 are trans women,” the letter said.
> 
> “It is important to note that these acts of violence go beyond particular circumstances and reveal a structural discrimination that leaves trans people in conditions of extreme vulnerability . Trans women often face social and labour exclusion, which often forces them to survive in risky situations, while the State fails in its duty to protect them and guarantee their right to a dignified life,” it read.
> 
> The NGO insisted that “it cannot be accepted that contexts of violence justify the lack of attention and justice for trans victims , whose murders remain unpunished in most cases.”
> 
> “In addition to the murder of Valeska, on August 29, in the municipality of Soledad , the murder of Armando Torres Bohórquez , a sexually diverse man, was reported. He was shot in public. The incident took place on Carrera 10a with Calle 83, in the Los Almendros 5 stage neighborhood. The authorities were alerted about the shots in an area that was without electricity,” they mentioned.
> 
> “From Caribe Afirmativo, we demand that local and national authorities take urgent measures to thoroughly investigate this crime and to protect trans women in the Atlantic and throughout the country. We cannot continue to normalize violence against people with diverse gender identities . This new femicide must not go unpunished. Valeska's life matters, and we will continue to fight for justice and the rights of all LGBTIQ+ people,” they concluded.
