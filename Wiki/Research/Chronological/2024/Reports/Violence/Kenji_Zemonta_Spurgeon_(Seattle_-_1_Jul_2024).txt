> Kenji, a Black trans woman, was killed in Seattle on July 1. 


> On July 1st, 2024 we lost a young Black trans sibling and we heard not an outcry. Not a vibrant buzz from our community in Capitol Hill, not an outpour of outrage for a call to rally. Our local news sources retracted their resources and the publishing of the senseless death of Kenji Spurgeon was made invisible on the pages. Or the information provided was so limited it made her virtually invisible.
> 
> Kenji’s Black Trans life mattered and we mourn the absences and the invisibility of what we can not know. We mourn the silence of her story that has taken 18 days to reach our community. We mourn the ways gun violence took a 23 year old’s life, full of promise, and we bear the weight of knowing these tragedies are not Washington state specific.
> 
> When Kenji’s former teacher Malia Burns says, “Kenji was a bright light in our lives, known for an infectious smile and quick wit. Kenji had an extraordinary ability to uplift everyone around with laughter, a joke, a song, or a dance.”, we know Kenji was a ki. Though many of us have not met Kenji in the flesh, we feel the power of her light even through photos and the stories shared by her loved ones.
> 
> We know that young people, especially Black trans young people are the key to overturning a world riddled with anti-Blackness, transphobia, misogynoir, and premature death. So we honor the lives Kenji’s touched, and we grieve the future possibilities of the new world Kenji may have ushered us into if given the opportunity at life.
> 
> Many of us dream of the PNW to be a safe haven, of care and refuge for Black trans life, and we hope that it will one day become that for all our community. Rest well, Kenji.



> A woman was reported shot to death just after midnight in an E Pine parking lot.
> 
> In a chaotic sequence starting just before 12:30 AM Monday, police responded to reports of gunfire in the parking lot of Teto’s Cantina, the former Rancho Bravo restaurant at the corner of 10th and Pine across from Cal Anderson Park.
> 
> Arriving officers searched the lot before reporting a woman down at the scene and at least one person taken into custody amid crowds of people in the neighborhood during Pride festivities, according to East Precinct radio updates.
> 
> Seattle Fire was called to the scene but reported the victim had died of her injuries. UPDATE: “Crews attempted lifesaving efforts for an adult female but were unsuccessful,” SFD reports. “She was declared deceased at the scene.”
> 
> Homicide detectives were called the scene. Police were collecting evidence including video from the scene as E Pine was closed to traffic during the response. Police were also continuing to search for possible suspects reported leaving the scene. There were no additional reported arrests.
> 
> The Seattle Police Department has not provided details of the shooting or confirmed the killing. Q13 and KING are also reporting the deadly shooting but providing an E Pike location that differs from overnight emergency radio updates.
> 
> UPDATE 11:35 AM: SPD has confirmed the homicide investigation but has provided an incorrect location in the brief. Police say they do not yet know what led to the shooting:
> 
> Shortly before 12:30 a.m., 911 Dispatch (CARE) received a report of a shooting in the 1000 Block of East Pike Street. Police found a victim on the ground suffering from a gunshot wound. Officers provided aid until Seattle Fire Department arrived. Despite life-saving efforts SFD pronounced the victim deceased at the scene. The circumstances that led up to the shooting are unknown at this time. Homicide Unit detectives responded to the scene and are working to determine the circumstances that led up to the shooting. If anyone has information about this incident, please call SPD Violent Crimes Tip Line at (206) 233-5000 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.
> 
> Earlier in the night, police were investigating assaults involving someone shooting people with airgun pellets around Cal Anderson Park. There were no immediate reported arrests in those incidents. UPDATE: Police were investigating multiple possibly related incidents involving two males and airguns shooting either pellets or paintballs. Officers were called to Pine and Bellevue around midnight to talk with victims who said they believed they had been targeted in a hate assault in one of the shootings. Police were searching for two males last seen fleeing on Lime scooters in the area of Seattle University.
> 
> The killing would represent Seattle’s 28th homicide of the year according to the @homicideSeattle account. In 2023, Seattle marked a record 73 murders including seven victims across the East Precinct covering Capitol Hill and the Central District.
