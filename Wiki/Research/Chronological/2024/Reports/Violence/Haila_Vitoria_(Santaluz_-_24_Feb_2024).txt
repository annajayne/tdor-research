stabbed


> The Court of Justice of Bahia converted Laize de Almeida Silva's arrest into preventative arrest. She was arrested in the early hours of Saturday (24) for stabbing to death a 15-year-old trans girl, who identified herself as Haila Vitória, in Santaluz. The woman underwent a custody hearing this Monday (26) and must be transferred to a prison.
> 
> The Civil Police officially identified the victim as Bruno Santana de Souza. According to witnesses, Laize was in a bar, accompanied, when she started an argument with the teenager. Around 30 people were at the scene, according to judge Adiane Jaqueline Neves da Silva Oliveira's decision. 
> 
> Haila was stabbed and died instantly. The Military Police were called and arrested the suspect. At the Serrinha Territorial Police Station, Laize claimed self-defense, but the judge did not understand it that way, based on videos from security cameras.
> 
> "It can be seen from the video that Laize went towards Bruno, who pushed her, more than once, gesturing with open arms, as if he were complaining to her. In turn, the suspicion, which, it should be noted, is much taller than the victim, she demonstrated disregard for the situation, holding her hair up while the victim questioned something," the judge wrote.
> 
> Still in her understanding, "it was not clear that the suspect committed the crime in self-defense." The judge also took into account that the suspect faces a crime of bodily harm against an ex-partner. "It turns out that, in those records, the bailiff was unable to locate her for summons, and the suspension of the process and prescription was ordered, under the terms of article 366, CPP, after having been summoned by notice."
> 
> Haila's body was sent to the Serrinha Legal Medical Institute and there is no information about the date and place of the burial. 



> Trans girl appears stabbed to death on a public street this morning
> The reasons that sparked the fight still remain unclear.
> 
> A tragedy shocked the peaceful city of Santaluz, in the sisal region of Bahia, early this Saturday morning (24), with the brutal murder of a trans girl.
> 
> According to reports from the Military Police, the young woman was involved in a heated argument with a 23-year-old woman, in front of a bar located on the busy Avenida Castro Alves.
> 
> The conflict culminated in an act of extreme violence, where the victim was stabbed in the chest and died right there, on a sidewalk, before medical assistance even arrived.
> 
> The perpetrator of the crime, a resident of Conceição do Coité, a neighboring city, was detained by a security guard at the establishment and later handed over to the police, claiming to be acting in self-defense, however, the reasons that triggered the fight still remain unclear.
