> 
> The Mato Grosso LGBTQIA+ Pride Parade Association also issued a statement about the murder. The organization reported that it had contacted the State Group to Combat Homophobic Crimes (GECCH) and that it would demand that the authorities conduct a thorough investigation to identify those responsible for the crime.

> Bolsonarist hub city
> 
> The city in the interior of Mato Grosso is one of the best-known far-right hubs in Brazil. In 2022, for example, then-candidate Jair Bolsonaro (PL) received 76.95% of the votes, while Lula (PT), the winner of the national election, received only 23.05% of the valid votes in the municipality.
> 
> In a case that shocked the country, showing the perverse side of the increase in the circulation of weapons during the Bolsonaro government, seven people were victims of a massacre in a bar in Sinop. After two men bet R$4,000 on a game of pool, the loser returned to the place to take revenge on his tormentor and everyone in the bar, including killing an innocent teenager.
> 
> In the 2024 elections, the far right won the race for mayor against the liberal right, while there were not even center-right, center or left-wing candidates in the city. Roberto Doner (PL) was elected with 68.41% of the votes against 31.29% for Mirtes da Transterra (Novo).
> 
> The left also did not win any of the 15 seats in the City Council. The parties with elected candidates were: PL (3), Republicanos (3), MDB (3), Novo (2), PSDB (2), Solidariedade (1) and Podemos (1).
