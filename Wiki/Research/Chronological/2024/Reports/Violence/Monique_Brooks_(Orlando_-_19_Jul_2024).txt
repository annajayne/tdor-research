Other trans folx recently killed in Florida include Duval Princess, Nedra Sequence Moss, Semaj Billingslea, Tiffany Banks, Alexus “Kimmy” Braxton, Keri Washington , Royal Poetical Starz, and Jenny De Leon.
> 
> Florida is a dangerous place to be transgender. That’s not surprising information, but even I was taken aback by the media coverage. It was so sparse and lacking in detail. Was Monique alone? Did someone ride with her to the hospital? Did someone hold her hand while she died?
> 
> Was she treated well? Is her murder going to be robustly investigated? Just more and more questions.
> 
> Rest in power, Monique. Your friends are lifting up the joy and love you brought to the world. Your family is standing firm to seek justice in your name. Thank you for all that you gave to other women from your experiences and wisdom.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
