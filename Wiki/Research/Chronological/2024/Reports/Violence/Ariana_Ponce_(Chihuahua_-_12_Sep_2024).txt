stabbed


> During the early hours of Thursday, a transgender woman was found dead inside a home located in the Panamericana neighborhood, where according to information from the Forensic Medical Service (Semefo), she would have died as a result of multiple cutting and penetrating wounds in different parts of the body.
> 
> This is a woman who was known as Ariadna, however, it was established that her identity in official documents is José Alfredo, 25 years old , according to the evidence recovered and the samples taken by the staff of the Forensic Medical Service to the body that was seized inside a home.
> 
> The discovery took place at the intersection of Avenida Francisco Villa and Calle República de Panamá, which generated a strong police mobilization upon receiving, through 911, information that the body of a lifeless woman with traces of blood was inside the home.
> 
> Elements of the Municipal Public Security Directorate, as well as elements of the State Attorney General's Office, attended the scene of the crime and were in charge of securing the scene of the possible crime, as well as collecting the necessary evidence that could help clarify these events.
> 
> After expert personnel took charge of lifting the body and doing the necessary studies to clarify the cause of death, it was determined that she died from bilateral hemopneumothorax, which refers to the accumulation of air and blood in the pleural cavity, between the lungs and the pleura, which is the membrane that surrounds them.
> 
> The transgender woman's body had at least three stab wounds in different areas, including one very close to the heart, and traces and evidence were also found that suggest that at least one other person was at the scene, who has not been identified so far.
> 
> The wounds pierced the chest and part of the effects she suffered after this possible attack was that the wounds began to bleed and subsequently began to fill other vital organs that ultimately left the 25-year-old woman lifeless.
> 
> However, to date, no official information has been provided on the circumstances surrounding the tragic event, which maintains uncertainty about how the events occurred, and investigations by the staff of the State Attorney General's Office continue.
