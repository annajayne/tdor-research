Murder of transgender stylist in Ate: relatives find her body under her bed, after 5 days missing
October 16, 2024

The murder of a hairstylist in the district of Ate has shocked the neighbors and relatives of the victim. The body was found under his bed after having disappeared for several days. This tragic event has generated great concern in the community, which remains on alert due to the increasing number of crimes in the area, which shows the ineffectiveness of the state of emergency in Ate .

Transgender stylist Edgar Lorenzo Chirinos Álvarez , 54, was found dead on October 16 in his own beauty salon , located on Los Reyes Avenue, in the Ate district . His body was discovered by his relatives, who had been trying to contact him for days. According to initial investigations, Chirinos was murdered on the same day he disappeared, October 11 , and his body was hidden under his bed, wrapped in a blanket.

Chirinos' family became concerned after he did not respond to calls or messages for several days. When they noticed that his beauty salon remained closed , they decided to go to the premises. After getting no response, they asked the owner of the building to open the door, and that was when they found the body under the bed. The body had a cut on the neck and other injuries , which led the police to consider the case as a murder .

The murder weapon was also found inside the building, as well as a handwritten note that is being analyzed by the authorities. In addition, some of the stylist's personal items, such as her cell phone, cosmetics and a television, were missing.

The main suspect in the murder of the hairstylist in Ate is Christopher Mancilla Medina , Chirinos' partner. According to witnesses, the last time the victim was seen was during a meeting with friends and his partner on October 11. Since then, Mancilla has disappeared, and several witnesses saw him leave the room during the early hours of the following day, taking with him some objects, including the living room's television .

Neighbors and friends of the victim say that the relationship between Chirinos and Mancilla was conflictive, with frequent arguments and episodes of violence. These statements have led the authorities to focus on Mancilla as the main suspect in the crime.

Edgar Chirinos' family and friends are devastated by his tragic death. Speaking to the media, his cousin mentioned that the stylist had dedicated more than 15 years to his business and that he had never had serious problems with anyone, except his partner. Therefore, they demand that the authorities intensify the search for Christopher Mancilla and that justice be done for Chirinos' death.

Mancilla is still at large and the police have issued an arrest warrant for him. Investigations are ongoing and it is hoped that in the coming days the authorities will be able to clarify more details about the crime and determine the whereabouts of the suspect.

The murder of the hairstylist in Ate adds to a growing wave of crimes in the district, which has led authorities to declare a state of emergency in the area. Residents of Ate have expressed concern about insecurity, demanding greater police presence and stronger action to prevent future crimes.

Despite the measures implemented, such as patrols and police controls, residents continue to live in fear of the possibility of new acts of violence.

State of emergency in Ate fails to prevent another crime: murder of teacher shocks school community
Although Ate Vitarte is one of the districts under a state of emergency decreed by the government of Dina Boluarte, the measure was not enough to prevent the murder of a teacher inside a school, which occurred on October 14, when a hitman disguised as a worker of the Judiciary entered the IE Julio C. Tello and shot teacher Julio Pacheco Pimentel three times, causing his death in front of students and staff.
