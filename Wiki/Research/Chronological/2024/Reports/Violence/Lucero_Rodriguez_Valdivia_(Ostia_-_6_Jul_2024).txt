> Lucero's Sister, Trans Woman Found Dead in Ostia Pine Forest: "Inhumanely Abandoned"
> Lucero's sister asks for clarity on her death: "If anyone saw or knows anything, please come forward, I want to know what happened to her and if anyone hurt her."
> 
> On July 6, the body of a trans woman in an advanced state of decomposition was found inside the pine forest of Castel Fusano in Ostia. Her name was Lucero Rodriguez Valdivia , she was 48 years old and came from Peru . In Italy for over 10 years and with a regular residence permit, she worked as a sex worker right inside that thicket on the Roman coast where she was found. Her body remained in the undergrowth for at least a week, maybe ten days. Her friends and family are now wondering, is it possible that no one looked for her before?
> 
> According to the story of Lucero's friends (also sex workers), there had to be a driver, hired to take them to the pine forest and then take them home, since that is an area not served by public transport. Could he have seen something? We do not know if the man was tracked down and interviewed by the police, but according to those who worked with the victim, he could have valuable information on the matter.
> 
> "We are talking about a hate crime," says Asia Cione , spokesperson and activist for the Libellula Italia ATS association, " regardless of the cause of death. Those who knew Lucero think she was killed, but even if it was a sudden illness, we are talking about a person left for days and days thrown in the undergrowth without anyone looking for her or helping her in any way. Trans people are always treated like second-class citizens, even when they die."
> 
> Yesterday, an autopsy was ordered on Lucero's body at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata. A fundamental test to understand the cause of death, since no obvious signs of violence were found on his body. "At the moment we are not excluding any possibility," the investigators continue to repeat half-heartedly.
> 
> In the meantime, Pamela Rodr√≠guez , Lucero's sister, arrived in Rome from Germany yesterday after hearing the tragic news. She too was interviewed by the Carabinieri and is still very shocked by what happened. "What happened to my sister is inhuman, no one deserves to die like this and be forgotten like an old rag thrown in a corner ," Pamela told us shortly after her arrival in Italy. " Those who haven't spoken can still make up for it and come forward to tell what happened to my sister, please tell me what they did to her."
