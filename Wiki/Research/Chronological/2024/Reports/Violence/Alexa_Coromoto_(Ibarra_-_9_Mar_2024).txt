> Early on the morning of March 9, around 03:00, the alarms went off in the Caranqui sector. Paramedics and police went to the streets of Ulpiano Benítez and Sánchez y Cifuentes, where they reported that there was one injured person and another held by the mob. When the ambulance arrived at the scene, they only confirmed that Alexis Coromoto S., 36 years old, a transsexual known as 'Alexa', had died. While this was happening, a few meters away they arrested Ángel Asmabel G., 34 years old, who was identified as the alleged cause of the violent death of the Venezuelan.
> 
> The investigation determined that the man was responsible for the death of 'Alexa', who was engaged in sex work, without giving validity to the testimony of the defendant, who assured that he did not take her life, despite having stolen 500 dollars from her. For the Venezuelan subject, the event changed his life. He remembers that on March 8 he was drinking with a group of people who were in his charge at a construction site and then he went to drop them off at their homes. When passing through Olmedo Street, the deceased approached his car and asked him to give him a ride to Caranqui. The man says he agreed, but when they arrived at the exact point, 'Alexa' got out taking with her the money that was intended for the payment of his employees. 
> 
> Angel said that, when he noticed that she had taken the money, he immediately looked for her, finding her several blocks away. But that's when the worst began, because 'Alexa' denied having taken the money, however, a car was following her closely. When the man arrested today began to complain about the alleged robbery, the sex worker told him to move away because she was armed, according to the accused. Then the subjects who were following him got out and he claims that one of them killed him.
> 
> Several residents gathered at the site trying to attack Angel, but the police quickly arrived and arrested him, as he was identified as the main suspect. His story that other people killed 'Alexa' was not proven, so he was called to trial for the alleged homicide and is awaiting a trial date. His wife testified before the judge, assuring that the money did exist and that her partner never had problems with anyone, so she asked that the case be analyzed and his innocence be proven.
