> Alarm bells are ringing again in the LGBTIQ+ community in Colombia after two people were murdered last weekend in both Antioquia and La Guajira.
> 
> In the first case, the victim was Karis Saldarriaga, a transgender woman who was an icon in Antioquia, who was found dead last Sunday, October 20, in her apartment, located in the municipality of Caldas, in the south of the department, reported the NGO Caribe Informativo.
> 
> The lifeless body of Saldarriaga, 61 years old at the time of his death, showed evidence of several stab wounds in the neck and chest, according to the police report of the crime.
> 
> “Karis' murder has deeply shocked her family, friends, and the community of activists and human rights defenders, especially those fighting for the rights of the LGBTIQ+ population,” they said.
> 
> They recalled in Caribe Affirmativo that the transgender woman was one of the protagonists of the book Locas de pueblo: maricas mayors en lospopulaciones de Antioquia , by Guillermo Correa, a member of that NGO, where they collected her story of resilience in the face of discrimination and violence of which she was a victim for religious, social and political reasons in the aforementioned department.
> 
> “With this case, the Human Rights Observatory of Caribe Afirmativo records 21 cases of trans people murdered in 2024. However, the organization warns that this figure could be higher, due to an underreporting of cases that are not always reported or properly recorded by the authorities,” they said.
> 
> They added that the crime, since the victim was a human rights activist, would be investigated within the Special Investigation Unit of the Attorney General's Office, although they hope that the investigations will take into account that he also worked with the LGBTIQ+ community.
> 
> “While it is true that we celebrate its prioritization by this special group, it is equally true that it raises concerns about the application of the approach to diverse sexual orientations and gender identities established in Directive 006 of 2023. For this reason, the organization expressly requests the Director of the Special Investigation Unit (UEI) to link or allow the assistance of the specialized group in crimes motivated by the osigeg (diverse sexual orientations and identities and gender expressions) of the victims,” they urged.
>
> The other victim was the openly gay young man Geiner Carrillo Ipuana who was found dead, also with stab wounds, in the municipality of Albania, in the center of the department of La Guajira.
> 
> The victim had been reported missing since Saturday, October 19, until her body was found on Monday in the El Cerro sector, where she lived and worked, Caribe Afirmativo also reported.
> 
> "This crime adds to the worrying number of murders against LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia, being the 36th case registered so far this year by the Human Rights Observatory of Caribe Afirmativo ," they said in the NGO.
> 
> Carrillo Ipuana worked with the consortium that is working on the rehabilitation of the road corridor between Cuestecita and La Florida, but he did not show up at the company to work the night shift that corresponded to him.
> 
> "Geiner's murder has caused a stir in the region, especially among those who knew him as a hard-working young man committed to his community," they said.
> 
> They also asked the authorities to expedite their investigations and to take an OSIGEG approach.
> 
> “The judicial police are urged to consider the evidence that could point to a hate crime, and justice is demanded for Carrillo Ipuana. The case once again highlights the urgent need to strengthen protection strategies for the LGBTIQ+ population in Colombia,” they requested.
