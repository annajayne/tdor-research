> Transvestite Larissa, social name of Lucas Carvalho da Silva, was found dead and half-naked, with a hole in her neck, possibly a stab wound, on Rua Juruti, in the Liberdade sector, in São Félix do Xingu, southern Pará.
> 
> The victim's body was found on Wednesday afternoon (21) and identified by her mother. The identity of the perpetrator and the motive are still unknown. Teams from the São Félix do Xingu Police Station, linked to the Alto Xingu Regional Superintendence, are already investigating the case and are trying to determine whether it is a hate crime.
> 
> Agents from the 36th Military Police Battalion (BPM), under the command of Major Júlio, are searching for suspects. There were no cameras near the place where the victim was found. Larissa, as pointed out by the Civil Police, had already been the victim of an attempted murder in 2023. She was also suspected of some thefts and possibly robberies. For some time, she had also worked as a call girl. All details will be investigated, along with interviews with family and friends to find a possible suspect and motive.

The call is free and can be made from any phone. You can also send photos, videos, audios and your location to the virtual assistant Iara, via WhatsApp (91) 98115-9181.
