> Kassim Omar wanted to be heard.
> 
> Even after a 2022 shooting left her paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe on her own, she fought to be able to speak and tell her story.
> 
> Omar, 29, was a transgender woman and former refugee originally from Somalia. She had lived in the United States and Columbus since 2015.
> 
> Omar died from injuries related to the shooting that paralyzed her on Sept. 6, authorities said.
> 
> Two teenagers have been charged with murder in her death.
> 
> The Franklin County Coroner's office ruled Omar's death a homicide, as the cause was related to the 2022 shooting, said Chris Clark, chief juvenile prosecutor in the Franklin County Prosecutor's office.
> 
> Clark, who had previously charged the teens involved in the shooting with felonious assault, filed murder charges against both this month following Omar's death.
> 
> Ali Abdullahi, 16 at the time of the shooting, was previously tried as an adult in Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. He pleaded guilty to felonious assault with a gun specification and was sentenced to seven years in prison in February 2023, according to court records.
> 
> Because of his age, the then-12-year-old boy underwent proceedings to determine if he was competent to stand trial.
> 
> A Franklin County juvenile judge ruled him incompetent at the time and The Dispatch is not naming him because of his age.
> 
> "We are going to prosecute them for murder," Clark said. "It's unbelievably tragic that this happened to her. With all the things she went through to get to this country, and then for this to happen and to live the last parts of her years paralyzed. I can't imagine what she went through."
> 
> After she was shot, Omar spent most of her time in bed at an East Side nursing home, able to speak but do little else. She had previously loved to dance and sing, get dressed up and go out and just drive around in her car, she said.
