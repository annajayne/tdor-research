> Another shady story in a state infiltrated by organized crime
> On October 8, neighbors reported to Edomex authorities the discovery of a car in the town of San Lorenzo Nenamicoyan, Jilotepec, in which there were six charred bodies, as well as a skull.
> 
> The victims had been left unrecognizable due to the fire. The State of Mexico prosecutor 's office later managed to identify the six victims. Among them was Erika Daniela “N”, La Güera, a well-known drug dealer in the area. The remains of her husband, Erik “N”, alias El Pitbull, and Grecia, one of her daughters, were also found in the same car. The body of a trans woman, owner of a beauty salon, nicknamed La Diabla, was also located.
> 
> The discovery horrified a municipality whose calm had been shattered by shootings, executions, kidnappings and arrests in the dispute over control of drug sales.
> 
> During the investigation, the prosecution found WhatsApp messages in which La Güera had referred to a series of recent threats. For example, she had been afraid to attend a fair: “Maybe they will find us there and kill us,” she wrote.
> 
> A former partner nicknamed El Padrino, Christian Hernández Uribe, had broken up with her, probably over money issues . La Güera posted a message on her Facebook wall in which she revealed one of the threats. It was learned that El Padrino later sought her out at her house to demand that she take him down.
> 
> Authorities confirmed that the Jilotepec dead were small-scale drug shooters and were part of a group known as Los Peluches, linked to the Jalisco Nueva Generación Cartel . A commando of at least 15 subjects had deprived them of their freedom in a roundabout in the neighboring municipality of Cuautitlán Izcalli. At the place where the burned car was found, the police found spent .223 shell casings.
> 
> The search for The Godfather has begun.
> 
> The second part of the story happened a month later, on November 10, precisely in the San Francisco Tepojaco neighborhood of Cuautitlán Izcalli . That Sunday night, two men who had received a pair of handguns from a couple of motorcyclists a few streets away, arrived aboard a red vehicle at the Bling Bling Bar, a drug selling point, and swept away everyone who was there.
> 
> Six people were killed and four others were injured. The weapons that the attackers had received were .223 caliber. But there was something else: one of the dead, nicknamed El Gory, had been a friend of La Güera: they were part of a chat room called “AfterAfter” and were dedicated to the same activities as her.
> 
> El Gory was not, however, the only target of the attackers. A character known as El Cristian had been hanging around the bar that night. When he saw two men nicknamed Kiko and El Oso arrive at Bling Bling, who were part of the same cell as La Güera -- he reported to the men in the red vehicle: "They just came in," he told them. One of the attackers was later identified as Irvin Adonay, alias El Pinky.
> 
> According to some witnesses, Kiko managed to escape with the help of municipal police from Cuautitlán Izcalli. The others were not so lucky. Within a month, 12 members of the same cell were dead.
> 
> According to the investigation, La Güera's cell had begun to act on its own. This caused the main distributors in the area, known as El Remington and El Juárez, who occupy a higher level than El Padrino in the criminal structure, to decide to completely wipe out La Güera's group.
> 
> Investigators claim that El Juárez, his son El Cristian, and El Pinky were involved as perpetrators of the massacre and burning of Jilotepec. El Cristian and El Pinky would have been involved again in the Bling Bling massacre.
> 
> The level of monstrosity in this case reached such a point that, after giving the whistle to Bling Bling's killers, El Cristian called Gory's mother to inform her that her son had died and even showed up at his wake the next day.
> 
> According to sources from Edomex, at the top of the hierarchy of this criminal group is Ismael Molina, El Buchanans, direct leader of El Remington and El Juárez, whose area of ??influence covers 14 municipalities in the State of Mexico, as well as the Gustavo A. Madero and Azcapotzalco municipalities.
> 
> Arrested for a homicide committed in 2019, El Buchanans was released last year “due to lack of evidence.” That same year, he ordered the murder of three men and two women on the Mexico-Pachuca highway and regained control of criminal activities he had maintained from prison in Ecatepec, Tlalnepantla, Tecámac, Zumpango, Jilotepec and Cuautitlán Izcalli, as well as in areas of the state of Puebla.
> 
> The State of Mexico prosecutor's office has begun a series of arrests: last week, El Remington and El Juárez were arrested, as well as others involved in the massacres. Last Wednesday, El Buchanans was arrested by federal forces in Puebla.
> 
> Jilotepec and Izcalli are the microcosm of a country where thousands of criminal cells are unleashing various forms of horror. But at least here an extremely violent one was dismantled : a nightmare that spread during the fateful days of the hugs. Hopefully we are witnessing the warning of a new time.



> Through investigative acts, it was determined that on the day of the events, the victims were in an establishment with a beauty salon business, where HGV alias "La Diabla" worked, from where they traveled, aboard the aforementioned vehicle, to some soccer fields located in the Lomas de Cuautitlán Izcalli neighborhood, since GRR alias "La Gress" was going to participate in a match.
> 
> During the trip and at approximately 9:00 p.m., at the point known as the San Felipe roundabout, they were intercepted by at least 15 subjects traveling aboard four vehicles (a white Mazda, a white Durango, a gold Pointer and a wine-colored Versa), who subdued them with firearms and forced them to board said units to take them to the scene of the crime, where they were deprived of life, placed inside the Volkswagen vehicle and later set on fire. At this location, ballistic evidence caliber .223 rem. was found.
> 
> The remains were identified through forensic genetic testing and through their relationship with relatives who, in the last hours of October 8, reported their disappearance.
> 
> The main line of investigation established that the victims belonged to a criminal cell that operated mainly in the San Francisco Tepojaco and Lomas de Cuautitlán Izcalli neighborhoods of the same municipality, and that alias "La Güera" presumably had differences with a subject identified as alias "El Padrino", a member of a rival cell led by aliases "Juárez" and "Remington", which is why alias "La Güera" was ordered to be killed.
