> Thai man stabs transgender girlfriend to death in Koh Samui
> 
> A Thai man fatally stabbed his transgender girlfriend at a shopping mall on Koh Samui Island in the southern province of Surat Thani. He said he stabbed her to death because she insulted and belittled him.

> Officers from Bor Phut Police Station rushed to the shopping mall after receiving a stabbing report. The injured victim, 23 year old Rinlada, was taken to Thai International Hospital Samui before the police arrived. Rinlada reportedly sustained six stab wounds to her body and arms, as well as a head injury caused by a blow.
> 
> Officers managed to arrest the attacker, 23 year old Chokchai, at the scene. He was also taken to the same hospital due to an injury to his hand. Rinlada and Chokchai were treated in the same intensive care unit before Rinlada succumbed to her injuries.
> 
> Chokchai informed the police that he was an electrical technician while his transgender girlfriend worked as a salesperson at the shopping mall. They were in a relationship for about four months and were very much in love. They had never argued until a recent conflict about five days ago, which ultimately led to the fatal stabbing.
> 
> Chokchai claimed that Rinlada belittled and insulted him during a phone conversation. She also sent him insulting messages via the LINE application. He showed their conversation to the officers but the messages were not published due to their violent content.
> 
> Chokchai explained that they arrived at the shopping mall on his motorcycle. He removed the vehicleâ€™s shock absorber and carried it, along with a seven-inch knife. He struck Rinlada on the head with the shock absorber and repeatedly stabbed her until the knife broke.
> 
> Chokchai stated that he admitted to his wrongdoing and was willing to take responsibility for his actions. His actions led to two charges:

When Rinrada fought back and took the brake line away, Chokchai drew a knife he had brought with him and attacked her in a fit of rage. The police are now pursuing legal action against Chokchai Intharak.
