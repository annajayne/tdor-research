> The victim of the homicide  in Vila Brejal, in the Levada neighborhood, in the early hours of this Tuesday morning (19), was a homeless transvestite, who was found without clothes in an alley in the community. She was killed after being hit in the head. The information was provided by delegate Luci Mônica, in an interview with TV Pajuçara .
> 
> "The information we obtained is that she is a transvestite, known as "Joelma". The dynamics suggest that her head was hit against the ground, and that was where her death occurred. She was without her clothes, which which gives a sexual connotation. There probably could have been a fight, so her head was hit on the ground, to the point of killing her", he said.
> 
> The victim's body was covered with a sheet before being examined. The police confirmed that the transvestite lived on the streets, but no local resident wanted to give a statement out of fear.



> The Civil Police of Alagoas (PC/AL) began investigations into the death of a transvestite, whose preliminary identification is only as Joelma. The victim's body was found this Tuesday (19), and the first investigations indicate that her head was hit on the ground.
