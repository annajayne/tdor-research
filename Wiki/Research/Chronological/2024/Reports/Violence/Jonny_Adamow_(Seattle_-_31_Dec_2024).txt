> 
> Their name was Jonny Adamow, and were a victim of gun violence on New Years Eve 2024/2025, in Capitol Hill Seattle, WA. They were an artist and gender nonconforming, amazing friend and individual. 
> 
> They were walking home and a man shot them multiple times, when he tried to shoot someone else. 

> They were very involved in the drag community in Seattle, and well loved member of the renaissance faire community. 



> A 23-year-old Bellevue man has been arrested by U.S. Marshals and charged with the December 31st murder of Jonny Adamow at Broadway and Pike.
> 
> The office of the King County Prosecuting Attorney says Charles Hickman has been charged with first degree murder in the deadly late night ambush in which police say Hickman was targeting another person at the busy intersection.
> 
> Hickman was arrested by federal authorities Monday and booked into King County Jail that afternoon. He is held on $2 million bail.
> 
> Police have been searching for the suspect since the night of the murder. Prosecutors say detectives were able to identify the man through “video capturing unique identifying details and information from the witnesses present at the scene.”
> 
> The Seattle Police Department report on the investigation describes the suspect determined later to be Hickman circling the area in an Infinity, allegedly staking out the area preparing for the shooting targeting individuals in a group at the intersection’s gas station.
> 
> “A man now identified as Charles Michael Hickman exited the Infinity, walked onto the property of the 76 gas station and interacted with individuals at the gas station parking lot for several minutes,” the SPD report reads. “The video showed Hickman interacting with two individuals that appeared to be associated with the group associated with the Mercedes and the Nissan.”
> 
> The surveillance system at the service station captured images of Hickman and the clothes he was wearing — a dark jacket or hooded sweatshirt, dark pants “with a distinct and unique horizontal pattern between the right knee and right hip,” and white shoes.
> 
> Police say Hickman returned to his vehicle and again circled the area before pulling into the alley between Pine and Pike near the intersection with Broadway.
> 
> A memorial to Adamow grew at the scene of the murder
> 
> “At approximately 02:53:45, Hickman stepped out from behind the pillar and raised his arm. He took what appeared to be a shooting stance and appeared to be focused to the east of his position at the 76 Station,” the detective writes. “As Hickman does this the Victim appeared to step into the line of fire. Another male bystander with a noticeable limp was crossing the street at the same time. It appears possible both men crossed in between the Hickman’s intended target and the Hickman right as he fired.”
> 
> Police say Hickman fired what investigators believe were 10 rounds. Ten fired 9mm cartridge casings were found at the scene.
> 
> One hit Adamow who died of a gunshot wound to the chest.
> 
> Adamow was 29 and is remembered as an artist and friend by loved ones and family. “Jonny was a beloved nonbinary and queer member of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community, and fiercely proud of their Dominican heritage,” the Alphabet Alliance of Color group said about its memorial to Adamow on the utility pole at Pike and Broadway. The alliance said the New Yorker was “only in Seattle for a short term gig with their partner of 9 years” and asked for community support to mark their passing here.
> 
> Police say after his arrest, Hickman wrote an apology letter to the victim’s family. “I’m apologizing for my Action’s [sic] and nothing was intended for or to your boy, actualy [sic] for anyone,” police say the suspect wrote, “and wish my action’s [sic] and though process was way better than that.”
