> 
> The missing are Maricel Sialono Patabag alias Janice and Jano, 36, residents of Barangay Duangan, Pinamungajan City.
> 
> While the killers were three people on a motorcycle scooter.
> 
> Police Major Philip Libres, chief of Carbon Police Station 5 of the Cebu City Police Office, has checked the CCTVs in the area before and after the shooting happened.
> 
> When the police investigated the background of the victim, they found out that he was previously arrested at the Waterfront Police Station 3 on April 30, 2024 for illegal drugs and was released in June because he was on bail.
> 
> "That's why we are looking at this, we don't have (kuan) yet, but of course he has a record of being caught, so, let's focus on this aspect. He was able to come out on June 11 and then he was selling there, so there is a high chance of his arrest (the motive)," said Libres.
