> On the morning of last Saturday (30), a brutal crime shocked residents of Vale do Reginaldo, in Maceió. A 43-year-old transgender woman, identified as Jhessyka Loren Loran, was found dead on a staircase in the region, with at least three gunshot wounds to her body.
> 
> According to reports from the Military Police, locals called the authorities when they saw the victim lying on the ground and showing no vital signs. After the police arrived at the scene, the death was confirmed and the area was isolated to carry out the necessary procedures, including the presence of teams from the Criminalistics Institute and the Legal Medical Institute.
> 
> So far, information about the perpetrator of the crime is scarce, which makes the case even more intriguing. The Civil Police have already begun investigations to determine the circumstances and motivation behind this cruel homicide.
> 
> Unfortunately, cases of violence against trans people continue to be a sad reality in our society. The LGBT+ community often faces discrimination and violence, which reinforces the importance of public policies and affirmative actions to guarantee the protection and rights of these individuals.
> 
> The death of Jhessyka Loren Loran is yet another sad example of the vulnerability that many trans people face on a daily basis. It is essential that justice is served and that those responsible for this heinous act are identified and punished to the fullest extent of the law.
> 
> Our thoughts are with Jhessyka's family and friends, who are now facing the pain of losing a loved one in such a brutal and unjust way. May cases like this not be forgotten and may they serve as a warning of the need to combat intolerance and violence in all its forms.
