> Devany was attacked by another trans woman in the head, for a protection fee and is admitted to a hospital where she died.


> CDMX, first place in transfemicides
> March 13, 2024 20:05
> 
> Mexico City ranks first in transfemicides with eight cases this year, half of those registered in the country, the latest being that of Devanny García, whose death last February was the result of a “protection fee” in her work area, on Calzada de Tlalpan , in Cuauhtémoc.
> 
> Arlen Palestine, legal representative of the Elisa Martínez Women's Street Support Brigade, said that 1,200 trans women work intermittently on the road, and are "forced to pay a fee of between three and four thousand pesos."
> 
> Following her death, there is fear among her colleagues, which is why we demand that the Attorney General's Office reclassify the crime for which the investigation file was opened, which was that of injuries, when she went to the Balbuena Hospital, that of transfemicide .
> 
> The only state that modified its penal code to classify this crime is Nayarit, so “we have a long fight ahead for the rest of the country to do the same” and stop classifying the deaths of trans people as qualified homicide or femicide.
> 
> The lawyer claimed that “the payment of the rent is very subtle or forced, and is still violent,” and that after Devanny refused to pay, she was attacked, “being hit in the head with heels” which caused her to lose mobility and then fall into a coma.
> 
> She commented that the Tlalpan road is “more remunerated” than La Merced, which is why around 1,200 trans women work there, at different times and in different areas, but given the lack of progress in the investigation, there is fear.
> 
> Usiel Almaguer, Devanny's partner, demanded justice because "she was a victim of violence for collecting protection money in Tlalpan, near the Chabacano Metro, and lost her life, so I ask the authorities to arrest whoever did it, so that there is no impunity "
> 
> She mentioned that other colleagues have been assaulted and that is why "there is concern that the case will be brought to justice, so that there is not one more victim, and the investigation file can be completed."
