> On the night of Saturday, July 20, the community of Alluriquín, a rural parish of Santo Domingo, witnessed a tragic event that has left everyone in shock. Violeta*, a trans woman and soft drink merchant from the Baba canton, lost her life in a violent manner inside a local business.

> According to preliminary reports, both the victim and the hitman unexpectedly entered the establishment and after a struggle, approximately four shots were heard. Violeta* was found in the bathroom of the establishment with several bullet wounds that caused her instant death.
> 
> National Police officers arrived at the scene to collect evidence and begin the investigation. Violeta's* body was later transferred to the Santo Domingo Forensic Center for the corresponding autopsy. Her remains were then taken to her hometown of Baba, where they are being laid to rest at her mother's home.
> 
> The Asociación Silueta X and the entire LGBTQ+ community deeply regret this loss and extend our most sincere condolences to Violeta*’s family and friends. Her passing not only leaves a void in her close circle, but also in our community, which fights every day for equality and respect for human rights.
> 
> This tragic incident underscores the urgent need to ensure the safety and protection of all people, especially those in vulnerable communities.
> 
> For all of the above, we call upon the Attorney General of the State, Diana Salazar, the Police Commander, Carlos Cabrera, the Minister of Women and Human Rights, Arianna Tanca, and the Ombudsman of Ecuador, Cesar Córdoba Valverde, to carry out an exhaustive investigation to identify and bring to justice those responsible for this act. *Name Identity Protected
