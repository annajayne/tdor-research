> We deeply regret to report the tragic murder of Anastacia Castillo, a colleague from the town of Suchitepéquez, Mazatenango. Her life was brutally cut short by several gunshot wounds. We strongly condemn these acts of violence. We demand that the authorities conduct an exhaustive and urgent investigation so that justice is done on behalf of Anastacia and all trans women who have lost their lives as a result of brutal violence. We send our sincere condolences to Anastacia's family and friends. Not one more death, enough violence!
