Anti-Trans Violence in Texas Has Claimed the Lives of at Least 20 People Since 2020. The Latest Is Black Trans Woman Vanity Williams Who Was Shot to Death in Houston
August 16, 2024 by Sue
‘I don’t fear death! I fear injustice!’

Vanity Williams via HRC
A 34-year-old Black transgender woman named Vanity Williams was killed in Houston on August 3, 2024. Her death came to our attention through HRC.

The Crime
Vanity was found shot to death in a Houston home.

From the Houston Police Department

HPD patrol officers responded to a shooting call at the apartment complex at the above address and found an unresponsive female with gunshot wounds.  Houston Fire Department paramedics responded to the scene and pronounced the female, later identified as Ms. Williams, deceased.

Several days later, the St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana arrested the suspect in Vanity’s murder. Tristian Sanders, 26, was arrested after he was found at a home in the 600 Block of Lac Verret Drive in Luling. Sanders is in Louisiana custody awaiting extradition to Texas.

Honoring Vanity Williams
Vanity was born in Columbus, Mississippi. After graduating high school, she relocated to Houston, Texas. She studied at the University of Houston, According to friends, she was an Air Force veteran and recently began nursing school.

Vanity also used the name Chanel Williams on social media. Her friends told ABC she was a fan of makeup, nail art, and fashion. Her social media profiles suggest she was fluent in Spanish and Japanese. Vanity traveled throughout the US often visiting New York, DC, LA, and Florida. She appreciated a wide range of music and movies.

Friends have established a crowdfund to assist with final expenses and support Vanity’s loved ones.

There is no word yet on final arrangements.

The Context
That we know of, Vanity is the 31st trans person whose death has been reported in 2024. Reported means the death may have been earlier or that we do not have all of the details. You may notice in my list later in this post that I try to make some distinctions. As of this post, I have identified 26 individuals who were killed this year and 31 total individuals whose deaths became known to us this year.

I know this is confusing. Death cannot be neatly contained in data and reporting, but it is essential that we try to describe this epidemic of violence with every possible tool.

She is the 22nd trans woman, the 11th Black trans woman, and the 17th trans woman of color on our list. In total 22 out of the 26 individuals were BIPOC. As of this post, a trans person’s violent murder has been reported in the US every 7.3 days this year.

Texas is home to a significant number of deaths. From 2023:  Maria Jose Rivera Rivera (22) LaKendra Andrews (25) From 2022: Cypress Ramos (21) Paloma Velasquez  (29) Marisela Castro  (39) From 2021: Aidelen Evans (24) Tiffany Thomas  (38) Iris Santos  (22) Miss CoCo (44) Za’Niyah Williams (21) Rubi Dominguez (29) Martina Caldera (38) Kier Laprice (Kartier) Solomon (21) From 2020: Helle Jae O’Regan  (20) Asia Jynaé Foster (22) Chae’Meshia Simms (39) and earlier in 2024 Diamond Cherish Brigman (38) was also killed in Texas as well as Dylan Gurley (20). In 2022, a 62 year old trans woman died in her apartment in Carrollton, Texas but had no living family to claim her. We don’t know what became of her remains. Her name was Deirdre Sterling.

At least 20 violent deaths from Texas alone since 2020. Texas truly is a deadly state for trans folx of all ages. We must support our neighbors who remain there out of necessity or defiance.

Rest in power, Vanity. You brought so much good and healing to this world, surrounding yourself with good friends and beautiful things while you served our country and pursued your aspirations. Thank you for the legacy you indelibly left in Houston and beyond. I hope the capture of the person who stole your life helps you rest knowing he cannot hurt another.

May your memory be a revolution.
