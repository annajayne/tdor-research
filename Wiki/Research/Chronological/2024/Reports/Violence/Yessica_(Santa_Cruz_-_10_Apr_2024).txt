> On April 10, “Yessica,” as her companions knew her, was taken by two men - through deception - to a cemetery in Santa Cruz, to obtain sexual services. There, they forced her to strip, robbed her of her belongings and then brutally attacked her. They cut her hair, broke her teeth, cut her face and slit her throat.
> 
> Despite the signs of cruelty, her case was not classified as a femicide , nor as a murder based on her gender identity, much less as a hate crime. The perpetrators were found and the authorities stated that the motive for the murder was robbery .
> 
> The victim was not introduced as a trans woman, but rather as a 30-year-old man, identified as Yerko Mariobó.
> 
> "When a person is found dead, they are identified based solely on their genitals. That is why, for us, having access to justice is one of the biggest challenges," said Llanos.



> Boris Yerco Fernández, 30 years old, was allegedly murdered in a cemetery in Villa Primero de Mayo. So far, two subjects have been arrested for the crime. After learning about the incident and the arrests, relatives of the victim went to the offices of the Special Force to Fight Crime (FELCC) to demand justice and that these two people be sent to jail. “The causes of death would be open trauma, in the left parietal region, bruising on the right cheekbone and a 6-centimeter laceration wound on the left cheekbone and another 10-centimeter wound,” he said at a press conference.
