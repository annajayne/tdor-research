> Karolay Castillo, a trans woman who had been reported missing on July 24, was found on July 29 in the Medellín River. This was confirmed by the organization Caribe Afirmativo, which warned that the body has not been claimed by the Forensic Medicine.
> 
> According to the organization dedicated to the protection of the rights of the LGTBIQ+ population, Castillo was last seen on July 24 in the Prado Centro mud, in the commune of La Candelaria, while the body was found five days later by a homeless person, who alerted the authorities.
> 
> In light of the incident, the organization called on the authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of her death, and asked the Attorney General's Office to investigate whether Castillo was a victim of violence motivated by prejudice toward her gender identity.
> 
> They also asked the Mayor's Office of Medellín to implement concrete measures to protect the LGBTIQ+ community, highlighting the need to address not only violence, but also mental health and suicide issues that affect the community.
> 
> Recently, the murder of Verónica Dantes, 26, a well-known trans leader, was recorded. She was attacked by individuals with knives, who, according to the authorities, were captured after reviewing security cameras.
