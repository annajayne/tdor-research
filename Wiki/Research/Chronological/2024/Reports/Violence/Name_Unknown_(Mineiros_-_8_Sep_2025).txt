> Mulher trans queimada viva: pedreiro é condenado a 67 anos de prisão por assassinato
> The bricklayer accused of burning a trans woman alive in Mineiros , southwestern Goiás, was sentenced to 67 years in prison. José Wagner da Silva, 33, was convicted of aggravated homicide, including femicide, and procedural fraud. In his sentencing, the judge also ordered him to pay a minimum of R$50,000 to the victim's family.
> 
> In a statement, the defense said it is reviewing the sentence but intends to appeal the penalty. According to attorney Wallacy Borges Oliveira, the convicted man is a drug addict and alcoholic who did not act with specific intent and that a mental health incident will be requested for a more in-depth evaluation of his condition (read the full statement at the end of the text) .
> 
> The jury trial that resulted in the verdict was held on October 1st and lasted approximately 10 hours. In the indictment, the Public Prosecutor's Office requested the defendant be convicted of procedural fraud and aggravated homicide for the crime committed on September 8th, 2024.
> 
> See the qualifiers below:
> Vile motive (homophobia)
> Fire use
> Resource that hindered the defense
> Femicide
> The technical defense requested that the spontaneous confession be recognized as a mitigating factor and that the four qualifiers be excluded, but the jurors rejected the arguments.
> 
> José Wagner da Silva was sentenced to 65 years, one month, and 18 days for murder and two years, six months, and two days for procedural fraud , for setting the body on fire and cleaning up blood traces from the house where the crime took place. These sentences will be served in closed and semi-open prisons, respectively.
> 
> Burned alive
> In the sentencing, the judge acknowledged that the 23-year-old woman was burned alive by the defendant after being hit in the head. According to an excerpt from a report available at the sentencing, she was still breathing when she was dragged into the fire.
> 
> “The victim was breathing continuously and possibly perceptibly when she was dragged to the fire, as there was a considerable amount of burn residue in the victim’s trachea in the post mortem examination,” he reports.
> According to the judge, the charred nature of the body made immediate identification difficult, causing additional suffering for the family. "The defendant not only killed: he desecrated the body, destroyed the victim's physical identity, and increased the suffering of the bereaved ."
> 
> Motivation
> According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the crime took place on September 8, 2024, when José Wagner invited the victim to drink at his house after they met at an establishment.
> 
> According to the complaint, upon discovering that the victim was a trans woman, he began to harbor aversion and took advantage of a moment of distraction, which resulted in one of the qualifiers, to leave her unconscious by hitting her in the head with stones.
> 
> However, the defense says that he "did not act with specific intent" and that, at the time, he had been drinking alcohol for several days and had used cocaine for the first time.
> 
> "He had bought a new cell phone and they were listening to music. She dropped the cell phone and he says he got very angry, and that's why I even explain the issue of using alcohol mixed with cocaine, which may have created this situation, this moment of rage," Wallacy Borges, the accused's lawyer, told g1.
> According to the judge, José's sister said he had a history of violence and had previously threatened another brother with a knife. The judge also emphasized that the accused committed the crime while drunk and, allegedly, under the influence of cocaine, as the defense alleges.
> 
> José has been in pretrial detention since September of last year, the month the crime occurred. According to his defense, if the sentence is excessive, he will appeal the decision.
> 
> Defense note in full
> On October 1st, in Mineiros, Goiás, my client José Wagner's jury trial lasted more than 11 hours. In the end, the Sentencing Council accepted the Public Prosecutor's Office's accusation and set the sentence at almost 67 years in prison.
> 
> During the trial, the prosecution raised several qualifiers – vile motive, alleging homophobia, the victim's inability to defend herself, the use of fire to increase suffering, femicide, and procedural fraud.
> 
> The defense, however, demonstrated that José Wagner is a drug addict and alcoholic, and that in the days leading up to the incident, he had been drinking alcohol continuously and had even used cocaine for the first time. This combination produces cocaethylene, a substance produced in the liver when alcohol and cocaine are used simultaneously. Scientific studies indicate that cocaethylene directly compromises the functioning of the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for controlling emotions and rational decision-making, causing the individual to act impulsively and without full awareness of their actions.
> 
> Therefore, the defense argued that José Wagner did not act with specific intent, but rather under the direct influence of these substances, aggravated by his chemical dependency. A mental health incident will be requested for a more in-depth assessment of his condition.
> 
> Finally, I note that the defense intends to appeal the penalty. This analysis will be conducted with great care and attention, ensuring that all appropriate measures are taken in the pursuit of justice.
