> In an interview with São Carlos Agora , Naira's mother, Rosa Maria, shared her pain and outrage over the crime. "My daughter disappeared and on Monday we filed a police report. On Tuesday, they called me from São Paulo saying that my daughter had been found dead and stabbed," she said emotionally.
> 
> Rosa traveled to the capital of São Paulo to identify her daughter's body and was devastated by what she found. "It was a barbaric crime. They killed my daughter simply because she was a trans woman. She was killed in a cruel way, with stab wounds, bruised eyes, and signs of hanging. She suffered for the two or three days she was alive before she died," said the mother.
> 
> Due to the advanced state of decomposition of the body, Naira will be buried this Thursday (24) in São Carlos, without a wake. "I will have five minutes to cry for my daughter before burying her, because she was already decomposing," lamented Rosa.
> 
> According to her mother, Naira has always faced difficulties because of her identity. "She fought for her rights, always facing prejudice. And now this. My daughter didn't deserve this," said Rosa, promising to fight for justice. "My daughter's death will not be in vain. I will fight for her and for all trans people."
> 
> The Civil Police continue to investigate the case, and human rights groups expressed solidarity with the family, calling for more protection and justice for the LGBTQIA+ community.
