> This weekend, a shocking event shook Bahía Blanca and Salta. Rosario Sansone , 47, a well-known Salta activist for the rights of the LGBTQIA + community and resident of Bahía Blanca , was found dead in circumstances that are still being investigated. The tragic discovery occurred yesterday, around 8:30 in the morning, when Firefighters and Civil Defense personnel responded to a fire in a house on República Syrian Street at 1400, in the Universitario neighborhood.
> 
> According to police sources, when putting out the fire, rescuers found Sansone 's body on the elastic of a double bed, in a prone position . Although they are working on the assumption of a possible domestic accident, investigators are not ruling out other hypotheses. "We are in the middle of an investigation, we cannot confirm or rule out that it was a homicide ," said one of the agents involved in the case, according to colleagues from La Nueva.
> 
> At the scene of the accident, signs of disorder were found in a room next to where Sansone 's body lay, although both the gate and the access door were closed, which has raised questions among investigators.
> 
> Given this situation, the case was placed in the hands of the Functional Investigation and Trial Unit (UFIJ) No. 5 , specialized in homicide cases and headed by prosecutor Jorge Viego. Experts from the Scientific Police and the Departmental Investigations Directorate (DDI) of Bahía Blanca are working on the scene, and the autopsy, which will be performed today, will be crucial to determine the exact cause of the activist's death.
> 
> The Furias organization, which defends the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community in Bahía Blanca , has launched a fundraising campaign to help Sansone's family, who live in Salta, move to Bahía Blanca for the procedures and the final farewell to Rosario. Those interested in collaborating can do so at the transfer alias "furias.ong".
> 
> The LGBTQIA+ community and those who knew Rosario Sansone expressed their shock and pain at this loss. Her legacy as a human rights defender will continue to resonate as authorities work to clarify the circumstances of her tragic death.



> Rosario Sansone, a trans activist and leader in Bahía Blanca, spoke with Total Normalidad about her participation in the first Parliament of Diversities in the Provincial Chamber of Deputies , organized by the Frente de Todos bloc. The event took place within the framework of the 11th anniversary of the passing of the Gender Identity Law and the International Day of the Fight against Discrimination due to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. "We are living in a beautiful time, full of rights."
> 
> Sansone appeared, together with the Mar del Plata representative Yohana Maidana , to speak about the importance of trans resistance and demand the sanction of the transvestite-trans reparation law. The project establishes a reparatory pension for victims of institutional violence due to reasons of gender identity. “Historical reparation would be like compensation, that the State recognizes what it did to us, leaving us to our fate. Trans resistance has advanced so much that it is unimaginable that we continue to be denied rights.”
