> “Abuja Area Mama,” a Nigerian self-described crossdresser and sex worker who documented her life on social media, was found dead by the side of a highway near her home in Abuja this week. She was 33 years old.
> 
> “Mama” kept her full identity a secret online, but sometimes referred to herself as Ifeanyi in her videos — as we will throughout this article — and asked that others use she/her pronouns to describe her. Some have also referred to her as “Chantelle.” Her bio on TikTok, where she regularly uploaded videos about her work and personal life, described her as “the number one Abuja cross-dresser and queen of the street.”
> 
> Police say they found Ifeanyi’s body on the side of Katampe-Mabushi Expressway on Thursday, August 8, severely beaten and bruised. She was later pronounced dead at Maitama District Hospital. Abuja police chief Benneth Igweh has called for a “thorough and discreet” investigation into her killing, the BBC reported. Ifeanyi’s final video on Instagram this week noted that she was on her way to her boyfriend’s house, while her last TikTok video shows her riding in the backseat of a car.
> 
> News of Ifeanyi’s death sent shockwaves across Nigerian social media on Thursday and Friday this week. “We demand justice and an end to the violence,” representatives for The Initiative for Equal Rights (TIERs), a Nigerian LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, wrote in a statement on social media, referring to her as Chantelle. “If anyone has any information about her death that will aid the police in their investigations, reach out to TIERs, your safety will be guaranteed.”
> 
> Being gay is still illegal in Nigeria (as is “crossdressing,” which was made illegal in 2022), and police violence against LGBTQ+ people is commonplace, leading some queer and transgender Nigerians to flee the country. Others, however, have built online spaces where they can freely express themselves, as Ifeanyi sought to do through her social media pages.
> 
> Black LGBTQ+ advocates and public figures say that modern anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments in many African countries are tied to the long history of settler colonialism, particularly the enforced belief in Christianity in colonized territories. Religiously-affiliated groups like Family Watch International have been accused of influencing the passage of anti-LGBTQ+ laws in nations across the continent. In nearby Ghana, lawmakers earlier this year passed a draconian anti-LGBTQ+ bill which made identifying as LGBTQ+ a criminal offense; in Uganda, a Constitutional Court decision in April upheld the country’s infamous “Kill the Gays” law, which established the death penalty for acts of “aggravated homosexuality” when it was passed in 2023.







> LGBTQ+ activists in Nigeria are raising concerns about their safety after a popular cross-dresser was killed Thursday in the capital. Police have launched a probe into the killing, which activists say is one of many cases recorded in recent weeks.
> 
> Franklin Ejiogu is trying to come to terms with the tragedy that struck early Thursday -- his friend, a Nigerian cross-dresser known as the "Abuja Area Mama," was killed by unknown attackers.
> 
> Area Mama's body was found by the roadside. Ejiogu says it's not clear how the events unfolded, but the cross-dresser had a gunshot wound to his head.
> 
> He blames a recent surge in fatal attacks on LGBTQ+ people on the signing of the so-called Samoa Agreement by Nigerian authorities.
> 
> "What actually pushed up these hate crimes is the signing of this Samoa Agreement. Media houses in Nigeria broke news that Nigerian government was encouraging LGBTQ+ movement in Nigeria and now the nonstate actors are now targeting the transgender community members and nonbinary people,” he said. “On Sunday, one transperson was lynched in Kogi state and on Monday, another transperson was also lynched."
> 
> Ejiogu is the founder of Nigeria’s Creme De la Creme, a trans and nonbinary peoples' support organization. He says they've been issuing security warnings to community members on an online forum, and that’s where he hears about attacks.
> 
> Nigerian authorities signed the controversial Samoa Agreement, a pact between the EU and 79 other countries, including African, Caribbean and Pacific nations, on June 28.
> 
> Authorities say the agreement aims to strengthen partnerships for democratic norms and human rights as well as promote economic growth and development.
> 
> But critics, including members of parliament, said the deal needs to be clearer on clauses that promote gender rights.
> 
> Nigerian police have launched a probe into Area Mama's killing.
> 
> Abuja police spokesperson Josephine Adeh did not reply to VOA's request for comment.
> 
> But LGBTQ+ activist Promise Ohiri, known as Empress Cookie, said such a killing, if not punished, will embolden more homophobic crimes.
> 
> "This is a gateway to uncivilized injustices against the queer community especially the trans community, phobic people attacking us, start killing us illegally in a way that is not acceptable or even following the laws that criminalizes us,” Ohiri said. “We're really scared."
> 
> Nigeria's national law punishes same-sex relationships by up to 14 years in jail. And in the more conservative Muslim north, it could lead to a death sentence under sharia law.
> 
> In 2022, Nigerian authorities tried to enact a law to criminalize crossdressing, but the law was suspended following protests.
> 
> Months ago, Area Mama appeared in a viral video, saying he’d been targeted by a mob and injured with a machete.
> 
> Empress Cookie called for justice, saying, “This person that was murdered was human, and they need to give justice to this person. It's because Area Mama is a well-known person, that's why her own came to timeline and bloggers are posting it... but on a daily basis we're being killed."
> 
> More than 30 of Africa's 54 countries have laws criminalizing homosexuality. Many people, like Ejiogu and Empress Cookie, say they will continue to tread carefully.
