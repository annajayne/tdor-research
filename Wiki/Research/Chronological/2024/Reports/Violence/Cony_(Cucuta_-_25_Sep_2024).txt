> Cony, a homeless trans woman, was murdered in Cúcuta
> With Cony's murder, the number of homicides of LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia rises to 33 so far in 2024.
> 
> September 25, 2024. From Caribe Afirmativo, we deeply regret the murder of Cony, a homeless trans woman, who was brutally murdered in the Cuberos Niño neighborhood, Cúcuta. This crime increases to 33 the number of LGBTIQ+ people murdered in Colombia so far in 2024. Of these, 16 are trans women. 
> 
> Cony's murder is particularly alarming, as it occurred in the same sector where, last August, a couple of homeless people were found murdered, which highlights the latent danger and structural violence faced by homeless people.
> 
> This new case reflects the extreme vulnerability of LGBTIQ+ people living on the streets, who are exposed to multiple forms of violence, discrimination and exclusion. From Caribe Afirmativo, we demand an immediate and exhaustive investigation of this crime with a differential approach that takes into account violence due to prejudice towards LGBTIQ+ people. Likewise, we reiterate the urgent need for the authorities to adopt effective protection measures for LGBTIQ+ people throughout the national territory.
> 
> We call on local and national authorities to prioritize justice and protection actions that guarantee the human rights of LGBTIQ+ people, regardless of their gender identity or social status.



> Cúcuta - Human rights defenders in the municipality of Cúcuta express their concern about the increase in violent deaths of homeless people. Actions that are allegedly being carried out cruelly.
> “ We are concerned about the deaths of homeless people, which have increased not only in number but in form , and this may not only have to do with the criminal system we have in the city. Micro-trafficking is doing its thing, the latest deaths have been in the same areas that we have been reporting, practically places where we already know there are homeless people,” said Carlos Muñoz, a lawyer for the city.
> 
> She said that these violent actions are occurring “ especially in the early hours of the morning. Last month, a couple was found dead in the Cuberos Niño neighborhood and this week a trans woman was also murdered in this same neighborhood.”
> 
> Regarding the death of Conie, a trans woman murdered last Wednesday, she indicated that “it is known that in the early hours of the morning three subjects arrived wearing red, black and white t-shirts and who are identified as members of the “Carlos Pecueca” gang, they call themselves the minors, they arrived with a knife to stab the trans woman in various parts of her body causing her death. Two of these people were later captured .”
> 
> “Perhaps it is a complacency, which I have denounced, on the part of the police and intolerance on the part of the community in general. Let us remember that the call for “social cleansing” is serious because it is the systematic killing of people with the complacency of the civilian population. If you look at the comments on social networks or go out on the street, many people agree with the killing of homeless people and I think this is very worrying,” said the lawyer.
> 
> He also indicated that there is fear among some homeless people due to the increase in violent deaths of these people that has been recorded in Cúcuta.
