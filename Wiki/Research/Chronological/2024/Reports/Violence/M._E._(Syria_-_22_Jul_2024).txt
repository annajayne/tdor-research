M. E.

22 Jul 2024 [estimated date]
Syria
murdered



A Syrian refugee trans woman, identified only as M.E., was killed by the Free Syrian Army in collaboration with her family after she was deported from Turkey because she was HIV+.

Before that happened her trans status had been publicly leaked, so she was in immediate danger of harm even before being deported.

Her full name, age and the exact location are not known, but I estimate the murder occurred around 22 Jul 2024.
