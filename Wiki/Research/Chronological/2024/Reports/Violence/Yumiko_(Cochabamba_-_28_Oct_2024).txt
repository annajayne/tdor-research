beaten


> On the night of October 28, Yumiko was walking through the streets of Cochabamba, Bolivia. She was going to work like many other women do. But on her way she came across a group of people who approached her to attack her. 
> 
> It was not an assault or a fight. The beating was carried out with such cruelty, hatred and extreme violence that it caused brain death, which days later shut down his entire body.
> 
> Yumiko, like many trans women, was involved in sex work due to a lack of opportunities. Her case did not make it into the news agenda, which at the time revolved around the social crisis. The only thing left of the crime was the request for justice from her colleagues on social media and the search for help to bury her.   
> 
> Yumiko's murder is the fourth hate crime recorded in Bolivia in 2024 and the third transfemicide of the year, according to the LGBT Rights Observatory . The number is the highest publicly recorded among the annual figures reported in the last 15 years, in which there are 28 hate crimes, of which 21 are femicides.



> It is with deep pain and anger that we denounce the brutal beating of our trans colleague Yumiko, which occurred in the city of Cochabamba. This act of violence shocks us and reminds us of the urgent need to put an end to hate crimes against the trans community.
>
> Yumiko was a woman full of life, dreams and talent. The blows she suffered caused ""BRAIN DEATH, A DEATH IN LIFE""...this is a cowardly act that will not go unpunished. We demand that the authorities carry out an exhaustive investigation and that those responsible be punished in an exemplary manner.
>
> Violence against trans people is a reality that we cannot tolerate any longer. Every murder is a life taken away, a future cut short and a deep wound for the entire community. It is time for the authorities to take concrete measures to guarantee the safety and rights of trans people.
>
> We demand:
>
> * Immediate justice: Let the facts be clarified and the law be applied with all its weight.
>
> * Protection for trans people: Implement public policies that guarantee the safety and rights of the trans community.
>
> * Education and awareness: Promote education on diversity and respect for differences to eradicate transphobia.
>
> * Stop violence: Let's work together to prevent and eradicate violence against trans people.
>
> No more hate crimes! No more violence! Justice for Yumiko!
