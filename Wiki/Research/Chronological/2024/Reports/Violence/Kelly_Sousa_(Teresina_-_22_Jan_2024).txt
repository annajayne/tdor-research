> “When I got here, there had already been an explosion in the car. My sister lives with my mother. I believe it must have been a case of jealousy on my brother-in-law's part, but I don't know because I don't live here. The vehicle was quickly consumed by flames and was a total loss,” he reports.

> The Fire Department was called and managed to contain the flames. The victims were taken to the Teresina Emergency Hospital (HUT) for medical care. The Civil Police will investigate the case.
