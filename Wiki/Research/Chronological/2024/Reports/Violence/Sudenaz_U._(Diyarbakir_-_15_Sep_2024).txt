> Attached is the parliamentary question submitted by Diyarbakir Deputy Halide Türkoglu to the Minister of Family and Social Services Mahinur Özdemir Göktas regarding the knife attack on trans women Sudenaz U. and G. by AA and I.U in their homes in the Kayapinar district of Diyarbakir on September 15, 2024, which resulted in the death of Sudenaz U. and the injury of VV.
> 
> Türkoglu’s parliamentary question is as follows: “Every day, new attacks, hate crimes and murders targeting different sexual orientations and gender identities are added. The inadequacy of legal regulations to prevent such crimes, the failure to implement existing laws, the severe provocation reduction decisions of the courts, the practices of impunity and sexist, militarist policies have led to hate speech and hate crimes that have reached unstoppable levels in the country. Moreover, the statements of some public officials and media organizations can fuel this hatred, and social media is practically an invitation to lynching.

> Rejection of Suruç Municipality's "Mem û Zîn" decision!
> Rejection of Suruç Municipality's "Mem û Zîn" decision!
> People with different sexual orientations/gender identities are targeted by violence because they object to the discrimination they face and defend their right to life. Not only are these individuals' right to exist not recognized, they are subjected to prohibitions, oppression and violence, and their right to life is violated. Activists who want to defend their rights are not allowed to exercise even the most basic constitutional rights such as making press releases, holding meetings and demonstrations; rights defenders are sometimes detained or sent to prison.
> 
> Sudenaz U. has unfortunately become the latest example of such violence. On September 15, 2024, trans women named Sudenaz U. and G. were attacked with knives in their homes by two men in the Kayapinar district of Diyarbakir. Sudenaz U. lost her life in the attack, while VV was injured. According to the allegations reflected in the press; the perpetrators who killed trans woman Sudenaz, AA and I. U., looted the house after committing this murder.
> 
> The fact that this terrible attack occurred on the same day as a rally targeting LGBTI+ individuals under the name of “Big Family Gathering” has strengthened the belief that this murder is not a complete coincidence or an “isolated incident” and concerns that threats to the right to life of trans women will gradually increase. 
> 
> In this context; 
1. > Is your Ministry aware of the murder of trans woman Sudenaz U.? 
2. > What is your Ministry's opinion on whether the perpetrators of the murders of trans women, such as Ali Aküzüm and Ilyas Uçak, who killed Sudenaz, were encouraged to commit murder by discourses and policies that fueled hate crimes?
3. > While the right to life is the most fundamental right, what policies has your Ministry implemented to defend the right to life of trans women? To what extent does your Ministry take into consideration that the failure to implement policies that would prevent these murders paves the way for and legitimizes attacks on the right to life of trans women? 
4. > Until when will you remain silent about attacks on the right to life of trans women? 
5. > While those who want to avoid being discriminated against, not being marginalized, and defending their right to life are not allowed to come together in public spaces, what kind of measures are planned to be taken against such initiatives that fuel hatred and legitimize attacks against different sexual orientations and gender identities under the name of "Big Family Gathering"? Or will we continue to remain silent against these initiatives that may lead to an increase in hate crimes? 
6. > How many trans women were murdered during your term as minister? How many trans women were subjected to violence? How many perpetrators of violence were legally prosecuted?
7. > Do you think that the public service announcements broadcast on TRT, which is supposed to provide impartial broadcasting regarding the Great Family Reunion, could lead to an increase in hate crimes? Will your ministry take any action to have the TRT announcements that incite hate crimes removed?
