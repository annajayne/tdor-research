> violent crime. In the San Francisco extension, a sector known as La Selva, in the district of Grocio Prado, the lifeless body of a trans woman was found. From the investigations carried out at the scene, it was determined that she had three gunshot wounds to the head, in addition to a laceration that was presumed to have been caused by a blunt object. The executioner acted cruelly and left the body in an open field.
> 
> Facts
> Yesterday, shortly after 1 in the morning, a resident of this place informed the integrated patrol about the occurrence of shots. When the police and security team arrived, they found the body in a vacant lot and there were no personal documents in sight. Around there were only the 380 shell casings of the firearm used to murder this person, who is known as “Abigail.”
> 
> With the presence of the medical examiner and the prosecutor on duty, the legal proceedings proceeded. Based on the evidence that appeared at the scene of the crime, it is presumed that the victim tried to defend himself, but was unable to escape and received a blow to the head. The murderer also fired shots at point-blank range, not once but three times to the head. It was an execution, what happened in this open field in Grocio Prado.
> 
> Evidence
> The prosecutor determined that the body be transferred to the morgue of the Alto Larán district to continue with the proceedings. Meanwhile, police officers seized the shell casings found at the scene, as well as a ring that was found near the body. This object would not belong to the victim, it would have fallen at the moment the confrontation occurred, and it will be taken to the laboratory in search of fingerprints that would help find the murderer.
> 
> Likewise, it was noted that there are security cameras in this place. The closest to the open field is less than 100 meters away. The agents have required the collaboration of Grociopradinos neighbors to obtain the images that help decipher the identity of the subject who last saw “Abigail”; victim of a violent death, which cannot be ruled out as a “settling of scores,” said General Manuel Vidarte, head of the Ica Police Front.
