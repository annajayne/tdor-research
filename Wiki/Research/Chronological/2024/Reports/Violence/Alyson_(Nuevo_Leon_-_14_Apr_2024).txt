burned


> On April 14 in the Treviño neighborhood in the city of Monterrey, Nuevo León, in northern Mexico, a fire was reported in a neighborhood. According to information from local media , firefighters and civil protection personnel put out the fire and found the charred bodies of two people: that of a man and a trans woman.
> 
> According to Sylvia Pérez, activist and member of the Trans Monterrey Collective, the woman's name was Alison, she rented that room, she did sex work and she was 35 years old.
> 
> Until now, the Nuevo León State Prosecutor's Office has not reported the incident. In local press reports it was reported that personnel from the State Investigation Agency interviewed neighbors and the landlord and are looking for security cameras to identify those responsible. In the notes it emerged that “armed men in a vehicle arrived at Alison's home and set it on fire.”
> 
> This is a “collateral transfeminicide” crime, explains Sylvia Pérez. That is to say, “it apparently happened as a settling of accounts because the man was beheaded, but there are traces of violence against her which indicates that it is also a femicide due to transphobia,” explains the activist.
> 
> “Something we also noticed is that the media criminalized and revictimized Alison. They let it be seen as just another execution, they don't even mention that it is a femicide where there was hatred, cruelty,” she adds.
> 
> On the afternoon of April 16, activists called for a protest at the Prosecutor's Office to demand that it be investigated with a gender and human rights perspective.



> Manifesto for the transfeminicide of Alyson, a transgender woman killed in Monterrey:
> We are devastated by the tragic murder of Alyson, a transgender woman who was brutally murdered at her home in downtown Monterrey. This act of violence demands urgent need to activate the National LGBTI+ Action Protocol to ensure gender-inclusive justice.
> It is essential to avoid any type of discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sexual characteristics. In this regard, we urge the authorities to follow the fundamental principles which are: respect for dignity, equality and non-discrimination, differentiated and specialized approach, protection of personal data, free development of personality, non-secondary victimization, comprehensive protection of rights and non-criminalization.
> It's alarming the number of trans people killed so far this year, with 22 cases recorded between January and April. This situation demands immediate action by Mexican authorities to ensure the safety of LGBTIQ+ people, especially trans women, who are the most affected by the wave of hate that is generating throughout the country.
> We demand the creation of a National Transfeminicide Alert and that the governments of states where these hate crimes have been recorded should strongly speak out about it. Concrete action must be implemented to prevent and combat violence against the trans community, as well as to ensure justice and access to rights for all people.
> We cannot allow impunity and silence to continue to perpetuate these acts of violence. It is everyone's responsibility to demand a real and urgent change in the protection and recognition of the rights of trans people in Mexico. Together, we must fight for an inclusive and violence-free society for all people, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.
