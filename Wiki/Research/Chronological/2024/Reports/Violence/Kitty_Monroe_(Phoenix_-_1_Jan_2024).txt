> The first trans person killed in 2024 is Kitty Monroe, 43. Equally important, she lived in Phoenix, Arizona. Also, Kitty was a Latina trans woman.
> 
> The Crime
> Witnesses who came forward have said she was attacked about 2 a.m. Jan. 1 by a man and woman in the parking lot of Casa de Licores, a liquor drive-thru on Broadway Road near Ninth Street, the family said. 
> 
> Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Philip Krynsky told The Republic the initial investigation indicated the case was being handled as a fatal hit-and-run. Krynsky said he could not share some details of the case out of concern it could hinder the department’s investigation.
> 
> The family said a witness told her a man and woman were chasing Lugo, with the man slugging her in the back with a gun. Collapsed on the ground, Monnroe was then run over by the man’s black two-door truck, which was described as making a loud noise as if it had no exhaust. The family was told another driver then accidentally hit Munnroe.
> 
> There is no other information on the identities of the people who chased and assaulted Kitty or the two drivers who apparently ran over her body after she collapsed.
> 
> Kitty herself and her family recounted multiple incidents of violence she had experienced based on her identity. She had been beaten repeatedly, but if you watch the vied at the end of this post, you’ll hear the everyday indignities and trauma she experienced.I don’t love the whole video, but I do appreciate that Kitty gets to speak her truth to all of us.
> 
> Moreover, Kitty gave this interview in 2023 discussing her life, including the challenges of living as a transgender woman. Even the video is titled “transgender man” but it remains important because she speaks in her own voice. And she talks about the realities – being assaulted, the physical and emotional scars, the feeling of being misgendered, the realities of the lack of healthcare on her dental health, and so much more.
> 
> The illusion of beauty is wonderful. People are going to see what they want to see.
> 
> Honoring Kitty
> Kitty was born and raised in Phoenix the daughter of two Mexican immigrants. She attended The Academies at South Mountain. Kitty briefly lived in West Hollywood. She appreciated celebrities from Marilyn Monnroe to Amy Winehouse. Kitty followed several makeup and styling brands. She appears to have been very close to her family.
> 
> On the other hand, according to the Republic, Kitty, the oldest of seven children, spent a number of years living on the streets.. What’s more she recently returned home to care for her mother who is showing signs of early dementia. On New Year’s eve, her mother lent a black fur coat to Kitty. Her mother struggles with the thought that the dark color contributed to her death.
> 
> However, as is too often the case, the reporting is using the name Kitty was assigned at birth and male pronouns. Her family told the Arizona Republic that their sibling used male pronouns, but there are many profiles Kitty chose otherwise and in the video she talk about Kitty as her real self. Further,the, family has organized a car wash, sold food, and set up a GoFundMe to help pay with funeral expenses.
> 
> When I’m Kitty, I’m confident to tell the world.
> 
> The Context
> Kitty is the first transgender person whose violent death has been reported in 2024. She is the first Latina and the first woman of color.
> 
> In 2023, we lost 44 trans neighbors in 2023, 40 in 2022, and 57 neighbors in 2021. Here is hoping and working to ensure that 2024 has less violence to report.
> 
> Rest in power, Kitty. You circled through life with joy and beauty, telling your truth, and helping to break down barriers. Further, you touched many lives. It hurts my heart that you only made it 2 hours into the new year, but your memory lives on. You deserved to live in a world the loved and appreciated you. I am deeply sorry we have not yet created that world. Thank you for leaving part of your story on the video to help educate and enlighten.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
