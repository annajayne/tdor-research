> 
> Frida was assaulted and died after two years of ordeal as a tetraplegic
> Acceptess-T is deeply mourning again. We lost a trans woman to the Acceptess-T family. Frida was a Peruvian trans woman, who arrived in France in 2008 and since then she has been practicing sex work in the Boulogne forest in Paris.
> 
> Frida was one of the first people involved in our association, from her early days. She was always mobilized at historical events and marches Acceptess-T attended. Against the crime of extortion law, where she was persecuted by the French state, identity checks and many nights spent in custody, simply to practice sex work freely and independently. Frida was also present at the marches and events for the law of Marriage for All, and at all the Existrans marches and every December 1st, World AIDS Day. Frida also marked her presence in 2016 when we mobilized against the anti-prostitution law and she was on the front lines screaming her rage because she understood that by wanting to penalize clients sex workers would be forced to hide and seek. to find other strategies to keep working and prevent the police from being able to control and penalize customers. Frida was also on the front lines with a lot of anger after the murders of Vanesa Campos in 2018, Jessica Sarmiento in 2020 and Ivana in 2022. All victims of a context of serious insecurity because of this cursed law against prostitution in France.
> 
> Unfortunately, on August 8, 2022, this same law targeted Frida. That night, she was in the woods of Boulogne, trying to make a living to continue helping her mother and family in Peru. She had a violent altercation with a man who claimed to get free sex services and harassed Frida and her colleagues working nearby. This is how this stranger attacked Frida from behind with an iron bar, piercing and breaking her spine, breaking her lung and destroying her chest.
> 
> Frida was reduced to a tetraplegic life, and spent more than two years in hospital at the Kremlin Bicêtre hospital near Paris, until October 24, the day she died, after suffering the consequences of this barbaric aggression. If Frida died as a result of this assault, we want to remind that she is a victim of murder, and we demand that this characterization be recognized by the doctors in the act of death as well as by the investigating judge. It is also time to recall that this investigation has been slow and that we have not seen any real willingness to deepen or give it more interest. It’s also time to recall that the 2016 Anti-Prostitution Act has increased insecurity for free and independent sex workers like Frida and all those murdered in the past eight years. The abolitionist and prohibition system in France is responsible for the loss of lives in our communities. We want the safety, the rights and the opportunity to practice sex work without fear, without having to hide and without carrying the status of victims of prostitution. Frida, your memory will always live present and be part of the chapters of our history. Your deaths, like those of Vanesa, Jessyca, Ivana and Geraldine, remind us of how much danger trans women sex workers, especially migrants and undocumented, are. It is for them and through them that we will continue to fight. It is for them that we will continue to shout in Paris and in every corner of the world, on TDOR day and anytime, that trans people are murdered and that the state is totally indifferent. Trans murdered, complicit state. We created a fund raiser to help Frida's sister and family with legal costs and repatriation of her body, as well as funeral costs in Ancash, Peru. Please spread this information or donate if you can.
