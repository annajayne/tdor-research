Dylan is also survived by grandparents, Cynthia and Gary Storie of Little Elm, and Wesley and Tammie Gurley of Denton. Dylan leaves behind sisters, Senica Ciarallo of Little Elm, Michala Labue of Denton, and Alicen Gurley of Denton, as well as brothers, Ely Mendiola, Alex Mendiola, and Abel Mendiola of Little Elm.

> I have been dreading posting this for the past two days, not just because it's a sensitive topic, but also because it's not my first, and sadly, won't be my last 'rest in peace' post. Dylan was not only a friend, but also family to me. We have been by each other's side since sixth grade, and many of my early memories include her. Just four years ago, I made a similar post for another Gurley brother, and this feels so wrong and confusing for all of us. Dylan lit up the room whenever she entered it and was always ready for a good time. You would never see her without a smile beaming across her face, even during tough times. Dylan would find a way to make light of any situation. You may be gone, my sweet baby sister, but you will never be forgotten. We will live our lives courageously through Danny boy, and now you, our sweet angel. I can't believe God would take not only Danny from us,but now you, and I am angry. You didn't deserve to have your life taken from you so suddenly. I will never forget our late-night drives and endless laughter; you were the one who kept me going for so long. I will not stop until there is justice for Dylan Gurley. #justicefordylangurley


> Dylan Gurley was reportedly homeless. The poor girl was likely targeted for this reason.

> This has to stop. We’re literally being murdered just for existing.
