> STATEMENT: JMBF Strongly Condemns the Murder of Transgender Woman Ayub Ali in Tangail, Bangladesh
> 
> Paris, France; October 17, 2024: JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) condemns in the strongest possible terms the tragic and senseless murder of Ayub Ali, a 47-year-old transgender woman, who was brutally killed on October 12, 2024, in Tangail, Bangladesh. Her body, bearing clear signs of violence, was discovered the following morning in an abandoned house near the microbus stand in the new bus stand area of Tangail. The police found a cloth tightly wrapped around her neck, with evidence of struggle, suggesting that she may have been strangled. A murder case has been filed, and investigations are underway to bring those responsible to justice.
> 
> "This heinous crime is not just an attack on an individual but a stark reminder of the constant danger faced by transgender people in Bangladesh and around the world. It reflects the deep-rooted discrimination and violence that the transgender community continues to suffer," said Robert Simon, French LGBT rights activist and Chief Adviser of JMBF. "Ayub Ali's story of resilience and determination in the face of adversity underscores the urgent need for societal change. No one should face such a fate simply for living their truth."
> 
> Ayub Ali's life was one of struggle, resilience, and hope. Originally from the Bhavanipur Patuli area of Tangail Sadar Upazila, Ayub Ali faced societal exclusion and limited job opportunities due to her gender identity. Like many in her community, she initially survived by collecting money in markets and on public transportation. Finding this work demeaning, she sought a more dignified path, starting a small cloth business despite numerous challenges. She sold fabrics in rural areas and participated in seasonal sales during festivals like Eid and Puja. Ayub Ali also expressed herself through the performing arts, joining dance groups during festive occasions and acting in traditional "Yatrapala" performances, embodying female roles on stage.
> 
> "The murder of Ayub Ali is a stark violation of the fundamental rights of every human being to live with dignity and safety. The Bangladeshi authorities must ensure swift justice in this case and address the larger systemic violence faced by the transgender community," said Advocate Shahanur Islam, Bangladeshi human rights lawyer living in France and Founder President of JMBF. "We stand in solidarity with Ayub Ali's family and the entire transgender community in Bangladesh. The perpetrators must be held accountable, and the government must take concrete steps to protect the rights and lives of marginalized communities."
> 
> JMBF calls upon the Bangladeshi authorities to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation into this crime, ensuring that the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice. We also urge the government to take immediate action to improve the safety and protection of transgender individuals in the country, providing them with the support and opportunities they need to live with dignity and respect.
> 
> Ayub Ali's story serves as a painful reminder of the prejudice and violence that transgender individuals continue to face. Her determination to seek a better life in the face of adversity is an inspiration to many. JMBF remains committed to fighting for justice, equality, and the protection of all human rights, and we will continue to work towards a world where everyone, regardless of their gender identity, can live free from fear and violence.
