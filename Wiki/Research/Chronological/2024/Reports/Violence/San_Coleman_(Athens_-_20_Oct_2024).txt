> ATHENS, Ga. — A popular walking trail in Athens is now the center of a gruesome homicide investigation after a man walking his dog came across a bloody scene over the weekend.
> The Trail Creek Trail runs parallel to Oakridge Avenue off Vine Street and is just roughly a mile northeast of downtown Athens.
> 
> Athens-Clarke County Police were dispatched to the trail behind the University of Georgia’s Chicopee Complex around 9 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 19, in reference to a person hurt along the concrete path.
> 
> It was 48-year-old Santonio Coleman who was found critically injured by a passerby on the trail.
> 
> His little sister, Lakiesha Fleming, said the man she knew as just "San" had gone out on Friday night, which wasn’t unusual. San was described as the life of the party, a colorful guy and someone didn’t shy away from his identity as a gay man.
> 
> “It was never a secret,” Fleming said, adding, “We loved him for who he was.”
> 
> San was born and raised in Athens.
> 
> “He’s been in this same community for 47 years, and nobody ever hurt him,” Fleming explained.
> 
> However, Athens-Clarke County Police said someone killed San.
> 
> On Saturday morning, San’s mom explained she got a call asking her to get to the hospital because San was hurt.
> The family said they rushed to the hospital and found San covered in blood.
> 
> At the time, it was still being told to them that it appeared San had fallen and hit his head. However, the family said after seeing his injuries and going back to the trail where his body was found, they quickly realized something far more sinister had happened to him.
> 
> “He fell there, because he tried to keep on going,” Fleming said. She explained San’s body was about a mile from home. She believes he was attacked then tried to make his way home along the trail. She said his phone was taken so he couldn’t call for help.
> 
> Fleming said, “Apparently, he was holding his head and walking home."
> 
> San never made it home. He died hours after being rushed to the hospital.
> 
> “They took my best friend,” Fleming said through tears.
> 
> Fleming said they have no idea why anyone would want to hurt San. They question if his sexuality played any role in the attack. 11Alive asked Athens-Clarke County Police if they’re looking into the homicide as a possible hate crime.
> ACCP responded with the following statement: 
> 
> Detectives are investigating the circumstances that led to the death of Santonio Coleman. ACCPD does not have additional information to share as it is an active investigation.  We ask anyone with information about the incident to contact Detective Bradshaw at Christina.Bradshaw@accgov.com or 762-400-7323.
> 
> Fleming said no matter why her big brother was attacked, she won’t stop until those responsible are brought to justice.
> 
> “You’re going to pay for it," Fleming said. "Because I’m not going to let this go until the death of me. I promise you I’m not."
