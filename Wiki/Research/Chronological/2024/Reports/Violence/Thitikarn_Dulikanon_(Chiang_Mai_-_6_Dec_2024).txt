> Bilal Chefinu, a Moroccan national accused of murdering his girlfriend at her beauty clinic in Chiang Mai, is seen walking at Chiang Mai Airport last Thursday
> 
> Rabat — Thai police are asking Interpol to track down Moroccan Bilal Chefinu, who is on the run for allegedly killing his girlfriend and fleeing the country. 
> 
> The victim is a transgender woman identified as Thitikarn Dulikanon. She was found dead in her bedroom last Friday with strangled marks on her neck, according to reports. 
> 
> The suspected killer is her boyfriend, Bilal Chefinu, who Dulikanon lived with. 
> 
> Dulikanon ran a beauty clinic, where surveillance shows the couple entering on December 4. 
> 
> Chefinu was seen fleeing the scene alone in Dulikanon’s car before abandoning it near the airport. He reportedly took a plane to Hong Kong early Thursday. 
> 
> Police suspect he killed her before he fled. 
> 
> Dulikanon’s sister hadn’t heard from her for two days. At first, she thought that Dulikanon was travelling with Chefinu, but a housekeeper later found the body.

> The investigation is still ongoing. 
> 
> Meanwhile, Thailand is considered a haven for the LGBTQ+ community.  
> 
> In 2015, Thailand banned gender discrimination. Still, transgender people can’t legally change their gender which makes getting jobs, education, or even medical care a real struggle.
> 
> Many LGBTQ+ people face discrimination. A UN study suggests that almost half of LGBTQ+ workers and students reported being treated unfairly.
> 
> At the same time, LGBTQ+ people are at high risk of violence. Physical attacks and sexual abuse are common but often go unreported. 
> 
> The country made headlines in 2024 when it approved same-sex marriage. However, the law has not fully been implemented.
