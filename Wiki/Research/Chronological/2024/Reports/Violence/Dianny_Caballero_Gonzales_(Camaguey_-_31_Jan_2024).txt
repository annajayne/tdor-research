> Seventh femicide confirmed this year in Cuba; feminists call for prevention of gender crimes
> The Alas Tensas Gender Observatory and the Yo si te creo platform in Cuba confirmed the femicide of Dianny Caballero González, 23 years old, resident in Vertientes, Camagüey, the province with the most crimes of this type verified in the year that has just begun.
> 
> Caballero González was stabbed, presumably by her ex-partner, on January 31, in a public street in El Diezmero, San Miguel del Padrón, Havana, where she had gone to buy merchandise that she later sold in her town.
> 
> The alleged attacker, identified as Jorge Socarrás Guerra, turned himself into the Vertientes police two days after committing the crime.
> 
> Research carried out by independent feminist groups has made it possible to bring to light an aspect of violence on the island that a few years ago remained hidden and was denied by the authorities, who boasted of a country where women were equal to men and enjoyed, without fail, the protection of the State: gender crimes.
> 
> “The Alas Tensas Gender Observatory has been part of different initiatives: coalition reports such as the one presented at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), it has carried out campaigns, joint statements and systematic denunciations about violations of women's rights and also of women who participate in politics, contributing to positioning the fight against gender violence in Cuba,” Iliana Alvarez, general director of the Alas Tensas project, told Martí Noticias.
> 
> “The work of alerting, denouncing and making visible gender-based violence in Cuba and counting femicides will continue, but we want to give much greater importance to prevention. We know how important it is to save human lives and we will try to influence, logically, the government, so that this prevention work can be instrumentalized, since an organization, by itself, cannot influence a state of affairs. The fight against gender violence has to be transversal to the whole society,” she stressed.
> 
> In November 2023, the general secretary of the pro-government Federation of Cuban Women (FMC), Teresa Amarelle Boué, admitted the increase in gender-based murders of women in Cuba, but made sure to downplay the responsibility of the State, by using the term "femicide."
> 
> Cuban activists have demanded that the State approve a law against gender violence. Archive.

> It is "irresponsible" to clean up Cuba's image like this: feminists criticize UNDP Cuba's award for gender equality
> For several years now, independent women's movements have worked to integrate into public debate the problems that affect them and that urgently need to be resolved.
> 
> “There are a whole series of demands that we Cuban feminists have been demanding so that the State listens to us, and one of them is the establishment of a gender education program adapted to schools and different information centers in order to fight against this structural patriarchal system that corrodes society, which is the cause of machismo and therefore the deaths of women,” said the activist.
> 
> As of February 5, independent gender observatories have reported seven femicides in 2024. They are also investigating a case that would require access to the police investigation to be classified.
> 
> “We want to continue to influence the approval of a Comprehensive Law against gender violence, so that shelters can be implemented that can help save lives. They are so necessary that of the seven femicides we have recorded in 2024, five of them clearly occurred in the victims' homes,” Alvarez stressed.
> 
> The Alas Tensas executive called attention to the different forms of transphobia that occurred after the feminicide, on February 2, of the coordinator in Camagüey of the TransCuba Network, Helen García Artelles, "such as the delay in processing the case by the police and the morgue and the use of her dead name at the funeral home, showing all the faces of this form of discrimination."
> 
> In mid-2023, President Miguel Díaz-Canel tried to downplay the occurrence of femicides in Cuba, claiming that cases of gender violence are exaggerated and that citizen security is one of the "achievements" of the revolution.
