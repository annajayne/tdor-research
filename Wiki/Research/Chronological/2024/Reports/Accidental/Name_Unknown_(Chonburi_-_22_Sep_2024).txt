fell


> A 20-year-old trans woman fell to her death from a six-story condominium in Chonburi, with further investigations revealing that she was wanted on human trafficking charges. The incident occurred at 17:30 on September 22, at a condo located in Moo 12, Na Pa Subdistrict, Mueang District, Chonburi Province.
> 
> Police from the Mueang Chonburi Station, along with a rescue team from Trikunatham Foundation, rushed to the scene after receiving reports of a person falling from a height. The victim, identified as Mr. Tawan (surname withheld), a 20-year-old trans woman from Surat Thani, was found in critical condition, face down on the ground. Despite the rescue team's efforts to revive her, she succumbed to her injuries shortly after.
> 
> Eyewitnesses reported that they did not know much about the victim, only that she had rented two rooms in the condo. Moments before the fall, she was seen coming out of the room, seemingly trying to climb from one room to the other by the balconies, when she tragically fell. However, no one was aware of her legal troubles until after the incident.
> 
> Further investigation by the authorities revealed that the deceased had a court warrant issued for her arrest on human trafficking charges. Police are currently investigating whether the impending arrest may have caused her distress and led to a possible suicide, or if the fall was an accidental result of trying to move between rooms.
> 
> The investigation is ongoing as authorities question individuals close to the victim and examine the circumstances surrounding the incident.
>
