> I was hoping to add a name to the list of lives lost for this year. Aofie Dovah Velspira, a courageous trans woman from Chubbuck whose strength and resilience inspired many. Since August 1st, 2024, she endured unimaginable challenges after a violent incident with her father left her severely injured. Despite her incredible fight, her kidneys and liver failed, and she passed September 13th, 2024.



> Hi my name it Aoife (ee-fa). I'm fundraising to pay my medical bills off & buy a vehicle.
>
> This is important to me because I've got congenital heart disease, autism, bipolar, ADHD, borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective, and gender dysphoria. I've got medical bills that I can't afford to pay that just keep adding up and affecting my credit. I've no job or income disability has been denying me for the last 7 years and now I'm homeless.
>
> I would like to get a cheap vehicle to live out of so that im not on the streets and have transportation to look for work. Every little bit helps me pay my medical debt off & get a used vehicle.
