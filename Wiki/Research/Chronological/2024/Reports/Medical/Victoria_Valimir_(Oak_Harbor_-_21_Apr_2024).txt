> Toren Victoria Valimir Obituary
> Toren Victoria “Vikki” Valimir, age 52, died peacefully while sleeping in her home in Oak Harbor, OH, on April 21, 2024.
> 
> Vikki was a beautiful, flamboyant, happy, and intelligent gay trans woman. She founded TransEthics.org and operated TransEthics social media accounts. She was a courageously fierce activist and advocate for minority communities. She often tried to find something positive in the face of negativity. Her passionate stories about good life experiences were endless. She had a bubbly personality, a witty sense of humor, and a unique way with words. She was able to make people laugh, smile, and feel better. She immensely loved animals, art, music, poetry, and Star Trek. Music was her love language. She often spontaneously broke out in song or poetry during conversations. Her love for and loyalty to those she loved was immense. Her capacity to forgive and not hold grudges when a squabble occurred was profound. She made many good memories with many people over the years. The time we had with her and the memories made therein are cherished by those she loved and those who loved her back, and will be for years to come.
> 
> Vikki is survived by: chosen sisters Phaylen Fairchild of OH, Ayael Amaré of VA, and Jojess Fournier of MI; chosen family Felicity Chevalier, and Kim Kelsey of OR; special friends Kyra Crocker, Melanie Thornton, Monika Benson, and Rowan Knox, all of Canada; and many others who she loved and who loved her.
> 
> Per Vikki’s wish, her body will be cremated and returned to the earth.
