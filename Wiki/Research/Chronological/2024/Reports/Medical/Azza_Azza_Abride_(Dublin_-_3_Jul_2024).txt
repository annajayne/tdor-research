> Trans teen allegedly raped by two men near GPO dies waiting for justice
> Family tell of devastation as alleged rapists will now never go on trial after the tragic death of young Aaron
> Aaron Bride was allegedly raped by two Eastern Europeans outside the GPO
> 
> The family of a transgender 19-year-old allegedly raped by two Eastern Europeans near Dublin’s GPO say they have been ‘failed by the State’ after the case was dropped following his death from cardiac arrest.
> 
> Aaron (Azza) Bride and his family from Malahide, Co Dublin waited almost three years for his alleged rapists to face trial — believing the men would be jailed given the strength of the evidence against them.
> 
> But on October 10, the State informed the court it was no longer proceeding to trial as Aaron was no longer alive to give evidence about the alleged attack on August 9, 2021.
> 
> Aaron identified as a woman and was known as Azza outside of the home but still retained the pronouns he/him. The teenager referred to himself as Aaron at home and asked to be referred to as Aaron during legal proceedings for the rape case.
> 
> “It [the trial) was all we had left,” Aaron’s devastated mum Jackie told the Sunday World this week. “As a family we wanted to fight this case for him.
> 
> “So to hear we couldn’t do that for him was a terrible blow.
> 
> “If the case had gone ahead more quickly, it would have been over and done with. And maybe Aaron could have gotten on with his life.
> 
> “Instead, our lives were all stopped and every time Aaron built himself up for the court case, he was told: ‘Not today!’
> 
> “How was he supposed to deal with that? How is anyone supposed to deal with that? I feel my son has been left down by this State. We were waiting two years before we even got the first date.
> 
> “And these men were caught red-handed — they were arrested by the gardaí that night.
> 
> “All the evidence was there, so why did it take so long?
> 
> “Aaron wasn’t allowed to get on with his life. And in the end, I believe it cost him his life!”
> 
> Prior to Aaron’s death in July, Aaron, mum Jackie and his sister Gwen were told the evidence against his alleged attackers was exceptionally strong.
> 
> Details of the initial hearing in the case, held two days after the alleged rape, reinforces this view.
> 
> In evidence given before Dublin District Court, Detective Garda James Campbell said the sex attack had lasted four minutes and was captured on CCTV.
> 
> He said footage showed Aaron, who was intoxicated, stumbling along O’Connell Street Upper.
> 
> He could be seen speaking to passers-by including the two defendants and a friend of theirs.
> 
> They were not known to Aaron.
> 
> It was alleged that while speaking to them “pushing and pulling was observed” before Aaron walked away.
> 
> Aaron was visible on CCTV passing the GPO followed by the three males. The two defendants were then observed running until they caught up with him at the junction with Prince’s Street.
> 
> There was a struggle and the 23-year-old man was seen on CCTV leading him down Prince’s Street.
> 
> The court heard Aaron was then pushed into a fire exit alcove of a building in the alley. Security camera footage showed him being forced down onto his knees.
> 
> The defendants’ friend used his smartphone to make a video.
> 
> Detective Garda Campbell said after four minutes a passing patrol car observed them and intervened.
> 
> The younger defendant was detained at the scene. The second man fled but he was caught after a foot chase.
> 
> The men claimed to gardaí it was consensual.
> 
> Aaron’s sister Gwen and mam said this week that they do not know if his alleged attackers targeted him that night because he was transgender — but they are in no doubt that their actions that night plunged the 19-year-old into a downward spiral.
> 
> Gwen, who was waiting for Aaron in their kitchen after their mam and dad went to collect him from Store Street, recalls her brother ‘sobbing like a baby’ when he returned.
> 
> “Aaron was taller than me and when he came in that night, he sat straight down on my lap and sobbed like a baby,” she said.
> 
> “I actually cradled him and I was rocking him like a baby … they ruined him!”
> 
> In the aftermath of the attack, Jackie said Aaron, who had never previously had any addiction issues became reliant on ‘street benzos’ as he struggled to cope with what had been done to him.
> 
> “I believe he felt they were the only thing that could help him reduce his anxiety enough to be able to walk back out the door again,” Jackie says sadly.
> 
> In spite of her brother’s trauma, Gwen says he had an inner strength that ultimately saw him become determined to face down his alleged attackers in court.
> 
> “Aaron was a strong person,” she said. “It takes a lot for a boy to go out there and wear girls’ clothes and to hold your head high.
> 
> “But for two years, what was done to him stripped him completely of the person that he was.
> 
> “We were meant to go for trial on December 4 last year and it didn’t go ahead after a week of toing and fro-ing. Aaron was so pissed off over that. He went back on the pills again for about two weeks.
> 
> “But then he had a really bad seizure and had to be taken into hospital by ambulance.
> 
> “After he came out of that he said to my mam: ‘Mam, I’ve had enough. I’m not going to let them ruin any more of my life.”
> 
> After the delay in December, the trial was scheduled to take place in April. But, again, it didn’t go ahead.
> 
> “Aaron passed away on July 3,” Jackie says sadly.
> 
> “He got up that morning at about 20 to 12 and I was chatting to him in the kitchen with my grandchild. Then I went up at about 12.25 to put away some clothes and I found him lying with his back to me on his bed.
> 
> “I said: ‘Aaron, wake up! It’s 12.25. You won’t be able to sleep tonight!’ But I got no response.
> 
> “And when I turned him round, he was purple between his nose and his mouth.”
> 
> Jackie said she began CPR and managed to get Aaron breathing again before an ambulance arrived and rushed him to Beaumont Hospital.
> 
> “They kept him on life support for the next four hours but every time they turned the machines off, he’d go again,” she said.
> 
> “They told us his death was caused a by a cardiac arrest. There’s no history of any heart disease in our family so we suspect, we don’t know, but we suspect his heart may have been damaged by the seizures from the benzos.”
> 
> Both Jackie and Gwen believe Aaron’s death is inextricably linked to the alleged attack and the three-year-wait he endured for justice.
> 
> “100pc, we believe Aaron’s death is down to what was done to him that night and to the delays in getting justice,” Gwen said.
> 
> “So, what we want now is for the system to change. I believe, if the trial had gone ahead on the planned date, and given the strength of the evidence, then those men would be locked up right now.
> 
> “There needs to be more judges allocated to hear cases involving sexual attacks.
> 
> “And there should be specific courts — away from those dealing with non-sexual offences — to hear them.
> 
> “That’s why we are going public with this. It’s all we can do now to get justice for my brother.”
