> County officials were warned about teen’s fentanyl use before she died of an overdose 
> On June 25, a 17-year-old transgender teen was found dead of a drug overdose inside Kids Kottage emergency foster shelter. Washoe County’s medical examiner classified her death as an accidental fentanyl overdose, but a number of questions about her death remain unanswered and Washoe County officials are refusing to release details citing an ongoing investigation and patient privacy and safety. 
> 
> What is known, based on a death investigation report released by the Reno Police Department through a public records request, is the teen had taken a drug test that morning which returned negative for any drug use. Social workers said she had been doing well with her sobriety and was having success with a new prescription for her mental health. However, according to her mother, the teen was in possession of fentanyl a week before her death, which the mother told officials in charge of her care.
> 
> According to the reports, her room and personal effects had also been searched just that morning, and RPD investigators could find no drugs or drug paraphernalia in her possession.
> 
> A source with information on the operations inside the for-profit Kids Kottage and who asked to remain anonymous also said Kids Kottage officials relocated more than a dozen children to another building on the campus for more than a month following the death. During this time, the source said, the youth slept in waiting room areas for lack of available beds, while the building the teenager died in remained empty. 




> A 17-year-old living at the region’s emergency children’s shelter, Kids Kottage, is dead of unknown causes, a Washoe County official confirmed today. 
> 
> Washoe County’s Human Services Agency operates Kids Kottage, which “serves the region’s abused and neglected children by providing emergency housing to children unable to be placed with foster families (or) relatives.”
> 
> County officials would not provide details about what happened.
> 
> “The Washoe County Human Services Agency (HSA) is grieving the sudden loss of a 17-year-old girl who passed away at the Kids Kottage on Tuesday, June 25, 2024,” Washoe County’s Bethany Drysdale said. “The cause of death is still pending. The Washoe County Regional Medical Examiner’s Office is investigating the death but will not be able to determine the cause for several weeks while they perform additional laboratory tests. There will be no further details provided at this time.”
> 
> A Washoe County report in 2023 said there has been “enormous growth in the need for emergency care provided by Kids Kottage. Generally, the goal is to place children directly in foster homes but due to
> extenuating circumstances there has always been a handful of children that are difficult to place. 
> 
> “This has become a larger issue over recent years as the community has seen the closure of pediatric psychiatric units and the department has faced a shortage of in-home foster care and in-home emergency foster care beds in the community largely driven by the economic effects of COVID.”
