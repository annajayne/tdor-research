> In the last few hours, a preliminary autopsy was carried out on the body of the 26-year-old trans youth from Los Toldos, identified as Junior Castro, who died on Saturday afternoon at his home in Junín.
> 
> The results showed that the apparent cause of death was cardiorespiratory arrest related to a drug overdose. On the other hand, toxicological and histopathological tests, as well as testimonials and expert reports from the deceased's partner, have yet to be carried out.
> 
> It should be remembered that the victim, originally from Los Toldos, was with her 24-year-old boyfriend at the time of the confusing episode, in the house they shared in the area of ​​​​Avenida Libertad, between Santos Vega and Sargento Cruz .
> 
> Following a call to 911 around 6 pm, police officers entered the home and found the victim without vital signs and his partner, who had to be rushed to Junín Hospital, given that he had stab wounds in the abdominal area.
> 
> According to judicial sources, the young man is recovering well but remains hospitalized in the health center with a drain. They say he has “psychiatric problems and a history of depression.”
> 
> On the other hand, they reported that the cut that Castro had “is superficial and is not a stab wound”; that is, that said wound “is not serious enough to cause death.”
> 
> The autopsy, to which Democracia had access, indicates that the victim's body had "a cutting wound in the left lateral cervical region measuring 3 centimeters in length by 1 centimeter in width, located 7 centimeters below the left earlobe." 
> 
> Finally, the report concludes that “the injury described would not be the cause of death.”
> 
> The incident was classified as "investigation into causes of death" and is being investigated by UFI No. 4 of the Junín Judicial Department, headed by its head, Dr. Pamela Ricci.

> 
> Prosecutor Pamela Ricci confirmed that the death of the young trans man, which occurred on Saturday, was due to an overdose, and elaborated on the scene found in the house, from where the other cohabitant was rescued and had to undergo surgery.
> 
> “It caught my attention that, being so young, there was no food in the house, and there was cocaine plus barbiturates, psychiatric medications and a large number of cigarette packs, all linked to consumption and no food,” said the judicial official, describing the scene they found in the house located on Avenida Libertad between Santos Vega and Sargento Cruz.
> 
> “When we approached the scene of the crime, the scene was dubious and there were several material issues that made us doubt the possibility of considering more than one hypothesis, to the Prosecutor's Office, to experts, to the Scientific People and even to the doctors at the morgue,” Ricci began by saying.
> 
> This is how “we went from the theory of homicide to considering the investigation of the causes of death, as long as the wound that the deceased person had was not something that could cause death, since it had not touched a key artery and the bleeding “It was very little.”
> “When the autopsy surgery was over, we were able to know that the death was caused by an overdose,” he said.
> 
> THE OTHER YOUNG MAN
> Regarding the other person who was found in the house where the lifeless body was found, Ricci said that “he was quickly intercepted by the police due to the need to establish what had happened and because he also had cuts in the abdomen – very deep – in the neck and in the legs. We took him to the medical emergency room and an hour later he underwent surgery.”
> 
> “Until that moment we had not been able to have a direct dialogue with him, so then I went to the hospital room and had an extensive conversation, which was not an investigation but a dialogue because I wanted to know the context of what had happened,” she pointed out.
> 
> In this context, the prosecutor assured that “there are underlying psychiatric pathologies in both people who were in the house and situations linked to a problematic consumption of narcotics, in addition to medication prescribed by psychiatrists.”
> 
> “It was a day in which, after consuming drugs and medicines, the transgender person Junior Castro – who was previously a girl and decided to perceive himself as a man – could not resist the consumption that caused his death,” explained the judicial official.
> 
> At the same time, she confirmed that the injuries that both presented “were self-inflicted at the same time as they were taking the narcotics and medicines,” adding that “I will have to delve deeper into the investigation, but a priori it was as if they had made an agreement between the two because they did not find meaning in life and had no family shelter.”
> To close the investigation, the man who remains hospitalized “will be summoned to testify as a witness, because we do not have him as a suspect or accused,” which will allow the final clarification of the event.
> 
> NO FOOD, ONLY DRUGS
> “It caught my attention that, being so young, there was no food in the house, but there was cocaine, barbiturates, psychiatric medications and a large number of cigarette packs, all related to consumption and no food,” she detailed about the scene found in the house.
> Finally, as regards the testimony of neighbors, they confirmed in statements to the prosecution that “they had never heard fights or raised voices in the house, which helps us rule out a possible attack by one person on another,” concluded the prosecutor.
