> CDMX.- Trans activist Irina Layevska Echeverría Gaytán, founder of the organization “Va por Cuba Solidarity Promoter,” died this Saturday in Mexico City, the organization itself reported. According to sources close to the matter, Echeverría was in a hospital in the Tláhuac municipality, where she died.

> “It is with great pain that we say goodbye to a critic, politician, trainer, left-wing activist, a comrade who showed us, among other great things, the importance of revolutionary continuity,” the group said in a brief statement.
> 
> On social media, the Cuban ambassador to Mexico, Marcos Rodríguez Costa, wrote: “With deep pain we received today the sad news of the physical departure of Cuba's dear friend Irina Layevska. Founder of the Solidarity Promoter 'Va por Cuba', worthy of the Medal of Friendship, combatant, militant and revolutionary.”
> 
> Echeverría was a candidate in 2020 to occupy the presidency of the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (Conapred) and is known for her fight for the human rights of people with disabilities and the LGBT+ communities in Mexico.
> 
> In May 2010, she resigned from her position on the external advisory group of Conapred, in protest against the presidential decree that established May 17 as the Day of Tolerance and Respect for Preferences, promulgated by President Felipe Calderón.
> 
> This was due to the fact that Echeverría believed that he said decree minimized the importance of making homophobia visible and combating it. During the six-year terms of Enrique Peña Nieto and Andrés Manuel López Obrador, that document was modified, until it was raised to the National Day against Homophobia, Lesbophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, as it is currently known.
> 
> In 2007, Echeverría published the book “Letter to my father. Testimony of a transsexual person”, in which she gives her testimony about what it means to be a trans woman.
> 
> The activist was active in various left-wing political parties, including the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico and the Revolutionary Workers Party. She was a founder of Morena, where she was active until her death.
