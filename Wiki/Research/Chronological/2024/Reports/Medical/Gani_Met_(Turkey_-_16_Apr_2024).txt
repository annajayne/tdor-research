kidney infection


We learned with sadness that Gani Met, one of the leading figures of the LGBTI+ Movement and founders of Pink Life, passed away last week in the hospital due to kidney failure and infection. 

To commemorate Gani, as Pembe Hayat LGBTI+ Solidarity Association and Kaos GL associations, we will visit Gani Met's grave on Sunday, April 21, 2024 at 15:00. After the cemetery visit, we will roast his halva with gull√ºm and madi koli at Pembe Hayat LGBTI+ Association. 

For details and participation in the cemetery visit and the halva roasting event that will take place afterwards, you can send a message to bilgi@pembehayat.org. 

My condolences to our community!
