> 
> The Military Brigade was promptly called to take over the incident and the Mobile Emergency Care Service arrived at the scene to certify the death. The cause of death is yet to be determined but it appears that it was due to natural causes. Information that has not yet been confirmed indicates that the victim had some health complications.
