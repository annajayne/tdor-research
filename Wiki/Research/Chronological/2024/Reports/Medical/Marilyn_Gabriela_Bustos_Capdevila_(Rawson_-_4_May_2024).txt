> This Tuesday night, May 7, the San Juan Police found a 36-year-old trans woman dead in her home in Barrio Sarmiento, in Rawson. According to judicial sources, Marylin Gabriela Bustos Capdevilla suffered a heart attack and had been dead between 48 and 72 hours. Prosecutors Francisco Pizarro and Gemma Cabrera, from the UFI Special Crimes, began an investigation into the incident that will probably end up being filed.
> 
> The first to arrive at the house were the troops from the 6th Police Station, alerted by Bustos Capdevilla's sister. The woman went to the police headquarters and she indicated that for four days she had not been able to communicate with her relative. This led to the agents approaching the house and seeing through a window that the trans woman was motionless in an armchair. Then they noticed that she had no vital signs, and they also smelled a putrefactive smell.
> 
> As a result of this, the uniformed officers called the Special Crimes prosecutor's office , which was represented in the case through Pizarro and Cabrera. Officials led the investigation , initially framed as a suspicious death. However, doubts began to dissipate within minutes. Medical examiner Beatriz VÃ¡zquez verified the scene and pointed out that there were no signs that there had been a violent death. The body showed signs of malnutrition and had been decomposing for two or three days.
> 
> An autopsy later revealed that the cause of death was a heart attack. According to sources in the case, Bustos Capdevilla had cirrhosis, among other complexities in his health. After analyzing the case, the prosecution will probably close the case, since it was a natural death.
> 
> After learning of the outcome, the LGBT community leader, Danny Love, made a post on her social networks. "You went baby, to the magical world, where we are only happy, where we will not discriminate against you, nor make fun of you, nor will we be false, nor will we leave you alone. Now you are Luz," she published.



> A trans woman is found dead and there is shock: "You left as a baby"
> The deceased is Marilyn Gabriela Bustos Capdevila, 36 years old. Her death has repercussions on the LGBT community, from where they say goodbye with sadness. 
> 
> This Wednesday, another fatal event shocked the province and, above all, the LGBTQ+ community. It is due to the death of Marilyn Gabriela Bustos Capdevila, a 36-year-old trans woman, who lived inside the Sarmiento neighborhood, in Rawson. There, she was found lifeless and they believe she had been like this for several days. 
> 
> According to what was recorded by judicial sources, Bustos suffered from a pathology and, since last Friday, he stopped maintaining contact with his relatives, precisely, with his sister. After several days without communication, the woman went to visit her and, unfortunately, she found the worst of her. 
> 
> Marilyn did not respond to repeated knocks on the door and that is why the San Juan Police intervened, after the sister's call. When they were able to access through a window, the victim was lying on a couch. 
> 
> Given this scenario, the Criminalistics Division and the UFI Special Crimes intervened, with the prosecutor's assistant on duty, Dr. Gema Cabrera. She coordinated the collection of data and was able to determine that there were no signs of criminality either in the house or on Bustos' body. In addition, they detailed that the deceased was in a state of dehydration and anorexia, so they presume that she had been lifeless for about 3 days. 
> 
> On social media, Danny Love, a leader in the LGBTQ+ community, announced what happened and lamented the sad loss of someone who was his friend for a long time. "You went baby, to where there is no ridicule, where we are not going to look at you believing ourselves to be superior," she said.
> 
> In addition, he added: "You went where we are not going to leave you alone, where we are not going to boast. You are light baby, thank you for your love." 
> 
> The information resonated as the minutes passed and several users who knew Bustos joined in the words of pain. "I will always remember her with all the energy of her dancing on stage.... now she dances on the stage where peace shines... she high," said another close friend.
