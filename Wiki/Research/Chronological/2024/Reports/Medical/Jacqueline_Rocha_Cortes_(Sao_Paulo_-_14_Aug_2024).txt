cardiac arrest


> The tireless activist of the AIDS movement Jacqueline Rocha Côrtes died on Wednesday afternoon (14), in São Paulo, at the age of 64, victim of cardiac arrest. Spiritualist, mother of Luara and Gilson, English teacher and former UN employee, she began her journey in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, on February 1, 1960. Her life, however, was marked by countless births and rebirths.
> 
> Her first major challenge was being born in a body that did not correspond to her identity. Even in her early childhood, at the age of 4, while playing barefoot in São Paulo, Jacque already recognized herself as a girl. However, it was only at the age of 16, when she read a news story in the newspaper, that she discovered what it meant to be transgender. It was at that moment that she realized that there were other people like her: of one sex, but feeling like they were another.
> 
> In her early 20s, Jacque began dressing in feminine clothing and wearing makeup for specific occasions, such as parties and gatherings with friends, where she believed she could express her true identity. Over time, her truth became increasingly assertive, culminating in hormone treatment at age 38, followed by genital reassignment surgery at age 41. This journey culminated in marriage and motherhood.
> 
> In 1994, at the age of 34, Jacque’s life was shaken by a new revolution: her AIDS diagnosis. This was a turning point. On June 6, 1994, when she went to get her test results, she received the news as a “death sentence with advance warning.”
> 
> However, Jacque volunteered for a clinical trial and, under the Sarney Law, began antiretroviral treatment.
> 
> The support of the social movement was crucial to her survival. At the Grupo de Incentivo à Vida (GIV), Jacque discovered that AIDS was a disease that affected the entire world, not just her – and this gave her a new chance at life. She came out of isolation, found support and witnessed different people living with AIDS. In 1996, she was one of the founders of the group that gave rise to the current National Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (RNP+ Brasil). She also participated actively in the National Movement of Positive Citizens.
> 
> From 2000 onwards, with intense activism both in Brazil and abroad – including participation in several United Nations assemblies –, Jacque began working on the issue of AIDS. She worked in the area of ??International Cooperation of the then National AIDS Program and in the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), where she became the first transgender consultant.
> 
> Her life, however, was not limited to these struggles. In late 1999, Jacque suffered a heart attack. In January 2000, after 11 hours of heart surgery, he went into cardiac arrest and had a near-death experience, which reinforced his faith in spirituality.
> 
> Retired, she lived for many years in the beach town of Araruama, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with her ex-husband and children.
> 
> Through all the revolutions in his life, Jacque remained steadfast until his last breath in the pursuit of being who he always was.
> 
> The wake and burial will be held this Thursday (15), at São Pedro Cemetery, in São Paulo.
> 
> Check out the tributes from friends and activists from all over Brazil below:
> 
> Nair Brito, from the National Movement of Positive Citizens
> 
> “Jacqueline, our Jacque. You paved the way for difficult paths for trans women. At the MNCP, you opened up a space that was yours and for all of us. Thank you for your boldness, strength and pioneering spirit. The movement of women with AIDS in Brazil bears your mark in every look, gesture and achievement. Thanks, my friend. See you soon!”
> 
> Julio Caetano, friend
> 
> “Jacqueline Rocha Côrtes was a mother and a woman of pure inspiration, a life marked by struggle, empowerment and sensitivity. Certainly, the friendly spirituality and her ancestors will welcome her with open arms.”

> Dr. Maria Clara Gianna, former coordinator of CRT/AIDS São Paulo
> 
> “Jacqueline Cortes, a dear friend with a big smile, an activist, and a dedicated mother who always loved to talk about her children. Her work was fundamental in the fight against HIV and AIDS. The documentary “My Name is Jacque”, which portrays her life and daily life, is a must-see! One of our last meetings was during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Jacque contributed, together with the National Movement of Positive Citizens, Latin American organizations and NGOs/AIDS, to a project that ensured that, during social isolation, medicines and support reached PLWHA (People Living with HIV/AIDS). I feel that anything I say will be insufficient to convey Jacque’s importance. I would like to express my deepest gratitude and enormous respect for this warrior woman.”
> 
> Dr. Pedro Chequer, former director of the National STD/AIDS Program
> 
> “For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die… as recorded in Ecclesiastes 3. Today I learn that Jacque has served her time. Did she leave prematurely? It is not up to us to question it, your time to leave has come, MAkTUB! We have known each other for a long time and worked together twice, in the AIDS Program and at UNAIDS Brazil, but even before that, we already considered you a tireless partner in the fight against AIDS and discrimination. Resolute, intelligent, zealous for your rights and the rights of people living with HIV, trans people, and minorities as a whole. Citizenship rights, no matter what label you give them. You made a great contribution to these causes, as a citizen and as a professional. You are gone, Jacque, but your legacy remains and will be remembered by all those who knew you or learned about your deeds. May your name be written by Adonai in the Book of Life!!!”

> Jean Carlos Dantas, from CRT/Aids São Paulo (via Facebook)
> “
> Today another star rose to the heavens. Her name is Jacqueline Rocha Cortes. She was one of my teachers in the field of activism/human rights and public policies for HIV/AIDS. Jacque was one of those people who left a mark on the lives of those who knew her. She really made beautiful lemonade out of the sour lemons that life gave her. Keep on being beautiful, my friend.”
> 
> Roseli Tardelli, director of the AIDS Agency
> 
> “We had the pleasure and joy of living and working with our dear Jacqueline Côrtes. Intelligent, quick, helpful, incisive, welcoming, friendly, one of her greatest qualities was that she never let the ball drop: she always found a way to get around or resolve an unpleasant situation. She never lacked courage, strength and determination. May her trajectory, open and broad view of life inspire people who, from now on, have the opportunity to get to know her through the film that was made in her honor or through the search for her legacy. I had this pleasure. I am grateful for it. I am a Kardecist because of my studies and the delicacy of life. I bet that when she realizes that she is an eternal spirit like we all are, she will run after Beloqui and Araújo to propose some interesting project to continue making the difference she made for the good on Earth.”

> In 2023, Jacque was invited by Agência Aids to participate in the Lecture Series on HIV/AIDS at Senac São Paulo.

> “The greatest! Without a doubt, for me she is the greatest! I met her before, long before I met her in person. She was the one who paved my path before I could even dream that I would follow it. I want to always remember her smile. The one who walked the path before me, the possible surgery, which was important to me. Life after the diagnosis was possible, because there was hope in her smile. I was so lucky to meet her on the path and to nourish myself with all her wisdom. Oh @jacquelinerochacortes, you will be so missed! The first trans person to enter the United Nations as a functionary, the one who paved my professional path. Jacque from the film “My Name is Jacque” will forever have in my heart the light of ancestry that is possible for us in a world that still oppresses and violates us for being who we are. She was the ray of hope that built bridges. She will always be my friend Jacque!”

> Barong Cultural Institute (via Facebook)
> 
> “At Barong, we are dismayed. @jacquelinerochacortes is an important name for social movements fighting against AIDS, LGBTI+ and, mainly, for the social movement of reassigned transgender women. A fighter, Jacqueline was extremely important to us here at Barong. In the animation “Respect my name”, she lent her voice and her appearance to be transformed into a cartoon. The
> animated film “Respect my name” worked on the step-by-step process of officially changing the name of trans people. To you, Jacqueline, our deepest gratitude. To her children, siblings, family and friends, our condolences. Jacqueline Rocha Côrtes, present!”
> 
> Christian Schneider, president of Gilead Sciences in Brazil
> 
> “It was with great sadness that I received the news of Jacque’s passing. My deepest condolences to all of her family and friends. Jacque was a source of inspiration. She had incredible energy and power of transformation. Her brand as a transgender woman transformed her into a highly competent professional, who was able to convey knowledge about all the challenges faced by the trans community in a sensitive and gentle way, promoting reflection and a paradigm shift about the cause for which she fought bravely. This is how the Transmutando Vidas Program came about, possibly the initiative with the most content generated about the trans community, disseminated among our employees to demystify stigmas imprinted on trans people. We are proud to have had her as a consultant and an inspiring woman in the constant search for a culture of inclusion and diversity.”

> Silvia Almeida, from the National Movement of Positive Citizens
> 
> “What can we say when people who have left their mark on our lives return to the spiritual plane? Speaking of Jacqueline Rocha, I can say that she lived a lot… She lived intensely, in many aspects, in many forms of activism, occupying countless spaces and places… She lived moments and dreams, many dreams… And what a heart for so much! Now, Jacque’s heart has gone to beat in the universe. Rest, my friend, rest until your next challenge! Gratitude.”
