> 
> A joint operation by the Civil Police of Paraná and São Paulo arrested transvestite Skalet, 56, suspected of performing clandestine plastic surgeries that resulted in the death of clients. The information is from delegate Luis Gustavo Timossi, of the Civil Police of Paraná (PC-PR).
> 
> According to him, Skalet was arrested in São Paulo (SP) this Thursday (20) as part of investigations related to the death of Cristiane Andrea da Silva, which occurred on October 24, 2024 in Ponta Grossa , in the Campos Gerais region of Paraná.
> 
> Skalet was indicted for murder and illegal practice of medicine. Together, the crimes are punishable by up to 22 years in prison under the Penal Code. The law also provides that if the illegal practice of medicine is practiced for profit, a fine is also applied.
> 
> The delegate states that the suspect does not yet have a qualified defense.
> 
> According to the delegate, Skalet worked as a "bombadeira", a term used for people who do not have medical training and apply industrial silicone or other substances for body modification, especially on trans women and transvestites.
> 
> The National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) prohibits the use of industrial silicone for cosmetic procedures. The substance, which is used to clean cars and airplane parts and waterproof tiles, can cause deformations, pain, difficulty walking and generalized infections.
> 
> "These procedures, carried out clandestinely, pose a high risk to health and can lead to death," says Timossi.
> For the delegate, Skalet's main targets were trans and transvestite people to take advantage of the social vulnerability of this group, which has difficulty accessing regular aesthetic procedures.
> 
> According to the investigation, Cristiane was not the first victim of the procedures carried out by Skalet. The delegate said that another death in the city of Marília (SP) , registered in 2019, is attributed to the suspect.
> 
> The police officer responsible for investigating Cristiane Andrea da Silva's case states that she died after hiring Skalet to apply industrial silicone (PMMA). The amount paid for the procedure was R$1,500, according to the investigation.
> 
> After complications during the procedure, Skalet fled. The victim was found and rescued by her husband, but died during medical care at an Emergency Care Unit (UPA), explains Luis Gustavo Timossi.
> 
> "The victim died after industrial silicone was applied to his body, in an environment described by experts as completely unhealthy and unsuitable for medical procedures," he says.
> After the death, the medical team called the police, who managed to identify the suspect and now arrest her.
> 
> Cristiane Andrea da Silva was 39 years old and worked as a hairdresser in Ponta Grossa. Born in São Jorge do Ivaí , she was buried in the neighboring city of Nova Esperança , in northwest Paraná.
