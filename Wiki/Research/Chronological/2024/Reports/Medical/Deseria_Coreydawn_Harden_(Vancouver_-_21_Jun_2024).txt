> Hello, I'm not sure if this is within the confines, but I would like to add that my chosen brother, Deseria Coreydawn Harden was a nonbinary transmasculine person (he/they) who died as a result of medical neglect this year on June 21st, 2024. Due to hospitalizations for mental health, a necessary heart procedure was put off repeatedly until this killed him at the age of 22. I know it's not a direct murder, but he was neglected by the system for years and years to the point that his death could have and should have been prevented. I feel that combined stigmas of his gender, his schizoaffective disorder and substance use concerns, his status as an ex-foster child, and his class conglomerated in medical neglect resulting in his death. I would be deeply appreciative if his name was added to the list of remembrance, though I understand if his death does not meet the parameters. Either way, it was good to advocate for his recognition today.



> Thank you very much. I've attached a photo of him and his kitten Macaroni who he loved very much. Unfortunately, there's not any links to their death as their family put all of the obituaries under his deadname.

> I appreciate this, thank you very much. You can absolutely quote me. He was deeply loved in the community, he never said a bad word about anyone, was fiercely protective of his loved ones, and loved a good punk show. He was sober and working towards recovery at the time of his death. It sucks that they finally got their feet under them and the medical neglect caught up, but he died knowing and trusting he was loved, which is really all I can as for.

> Thank you for doing this hard work.
