> There is nothing new in the phrase: "Brazil is the country that kills the most transvestites and transsexuals in the world". But every day there is a new grief upon her. Every day, the love of someone's life dies, who is a transvestite or transsexual person. Mine died on the 7th of this month. There are exactly 10 days until my birthday. In the month of "LGBTQIAPN+ pride". My friend Tine Taga is gone. She is 34 years old. She became a statistic.
> 
> Some say she died. Some say it was a heart attack. Some say it was pneumonia that was poorly treated. Some say that "there is no cure for certain diseases". Some justify it by saying that "her time has come", or that "she fulfilled her mission". Some think: "she was enchanted! It was what was agreed with Orum".
> 
> For me, Tine didn't die. Not because we turn those we love into memories and celebrate their existence in life or after death. Not because there are scheduled taxes. Not because we speak of her with affection and love. Not because we play her beautiful songs. But because she was killed. Just like most transvestites and transsexuals in our country. And it is ironically symbolic that this happens in the month of June, while the calendars are full of celebrations, discussions and speculations about the date, I try to deal with it, alone, in the fetal position, my mourning, my longing, for the person who left.

> For me, Tine is not dead. She was killed. She was killed by everyday fatphobia. She was killed by the absence of affection. Due to the lack of erotic and romantic touch. She was killed because she didn't fit into an MRI machine. Because she couldn't fit into clothes. Because she didn't fit your ideal of an acceptable person.
> 
> Some people might say: "it's the fault of whoever took care of her career." "It's the family's fault." "It's the friends' fault." Guilt, folks, doesn't get you anywhere. But yes, we are all responsible.
> 
> We are all responsible for Tine's death. I don't like the term guilt, because guilt is empty. It is part of the enjoyment. It revolves around itself and produces nothing. Responsibility is better suited. And it is, unfortunately, belatedly, from now on. We must all take responsibility for Tine's murder.
> 
> Yes! It is necessary to name what happened. You can't say that a 34-year-old person "died" when, months before, he needed an MRI exam and couldn't do it because he couldn't fit into the machine.
> 
> Some will say the usual: oh, but it was just about losing weight. Seriously?! Just today I received an email with the title: Obesity and overweight are expected to affect 68.1% of Brazilians by 2030. The research was released at the International Congress on Obesity (ICO 2024) this week in São Paulo. Ok. And what are we going to do about this? The only public policies in the sector are focused on weight loss. But what do people do when they can't lose weight?
> 
> In Tine's case, she died. She or he was killed, as I prefer to say. She was killed because she didn't fit.
> 
> The question asked by abolitionist and activist Sojourner Truth "and am I not a woman?" referring to the fact that she is a black woman and is not seen as a woman would fit here, adapted to the transvestite and fat intersections. I have already talked about this topic here.
> 
> There was a fetishization of Tine Taga's body. Our "Carnival star", judged by cis and thin women, for "dressing badly", without having her place as a transvestite and fat person considered when buying clothes. What were the options and possibilities? How could she not feel humiliated in a store or fitting room, if her body was not even supposed to exist on the streets?
> 
> Such provocations made me write the text "Virginia doesn't want to leave home anymore" in my book "gasolina & phosphorus" and dedicate it to Tine. I'm glad I did it in life. We never know when the last time is. But, I know, intimately, when it was the time I invited her to a party and I was able to read, to her dela, looking into her dela eyes dela, how sorry I was that she could n't exist. And I regret that it existed for such a short time.

> Researcher Maria Tereza Chehab recently coined the term "gordocídio" to explain what happens to fat people. According to her, "fatcide is the systematic and intentional elimination of fat people in a society, whether by active means (application of forces that result in death, such as subjecting fat people to risky surgeries solely for the purpose of losing weight and, often, without any guidance regarding the risks involved) or passive means (negligence and lack of assistance from the state, by denying access to fundamental rights, such as the absence of public policies aimed at the quality of life and health of fat people). Just like the word genocide, fatcide is a neologism created by me, precisely to emphasize this place of 'death' and specific extermination of fat people. In this context, I always highlight the articles that demonstrate deaths due to the State's negligence: lack of stretchers in hospitals, fat people waiting for care and dying in lines at the SUS, fat people undergoing examinations in zoos due to the lack of equipment in public and private hospitals. Fatcide is a consequence of pathologization and animalization and is, above all, intentional. In a society where the only public health policy for fat people is bariatric surgery and there are still projects to 'eradicate obesity', we are actually living under a eugenics program that does not see fat people as possible beings who deserve a quality of life like everyone else. They literally aim to exterminate us and make no secret of this goal. In her research, author Karen Slindvain Florindo talks a lot about the 'place of social death' of fat people and fatcide is a cycle: social death (caused by stigmatization and discrimination), physical death and epistemological death (death of our knowledge, of our epistemology, as Malu brings up in her research). She encompasses these three aspects. The term is directly related to Achille Mbembe's concept of necropolitics, insofar as it involves a State or society determining in which cases death is legitimized. In other words, it is not just about the State letting people die, but also about causing people to die through death management practices to control the deviant population to be eradicated", he explains.

> You may be comforting yourself by saying: but I have always treated you well. Yes, as she herself once wrote: everyone treated her, in general. But few chose. And that choice includes implicating yourself in what her body represented.
> 
> Tine was brilliant. Gigantic. Our carnivals will no longer be the same, it's a fact. And neither does my perception of life. It becomes even more ephemeral, even more urgent, even more numerical. Tine had faith in art.
> 
> It is absolutely urgent that we think: how could someone who sings so well, with so much talent, with so much faith in art, have been murdered at the age of 34? She died of depression. What causes depression? In addition to capitalism (laughing nervously), we can list, at first, transphobia and fatphobia. Tine didn't feel human. Chosen. Tine was unable to walk. Tine felt pain, physical and in his soul. Tine died fighting to live. And the responsibility is ours.
> 
> I think it's beautiful, beautiful and extremely important that we do shows in honor of her. Her name should resonate. The songs must be heard, as well as the audios that remained on WhatsApp, laughing, rambling, telling and exchanging about so many things.
> 
> It's beautiful. But taking responsibility goes beyond that. It's in the name of a fight so that other fat people - me, some close friends, etc. - can have MRI scans and fit into the machine. That we can fit on hospital gurneys. That we can fit into people's imaginations. The responsibility lies in including trans and transvestite people in our options for romantic affection. Who cried at Tine's wake and had already thought of her as a body to be loved? As someone to have sex with? As someone to date? And we will only take responsibility and free ourselves from the useless feeling of guilt when we get involved in these issues.
> 
> It won't do any good to approach me at the wake and tell me: wow, you're a psychoanalyst, let's take care of ourselves. Yes! Let's go. But let's also demand that public investment in the "fight against obesity" (a term I hate) is not about fighting fat bodies and killing them like we did with Tine, nor about compulsory weight loss, nor about holding meritocratically responsible for the person who doesn't managed to lose weight "in time" to live. But let it be about public investment in health and accessibility.
> 
> It doesn't help that we miss her at the same time as we think: she should have tried harder. An existence is collective. We recognize ourselves in each other. And we, as another, were very hard on Tine. We were brutal. We were intolerant. We were impatient. We were negligent. And, I say this also understanding that we are all fucked up and we did the best we could in many moments. And it wasn't enough.
> 
> I feel angry reading, on social media, the comments coated with false concern about health - mine, Tine's, any fat person - who can say that we are sick, but can't even move to welcome them. I feel absolute hatred when I have to read: her friend died because she was obese. Obesity kills.
> 
> Do you know what kills the most? Fatphobia. You know what else? Transphobia. You know what else? Misgovernment, lack of vaccine, pandemic, lack of investment in culture. You know what else? Reduction of resources in the area of ??culture. This all kills. But, of course, anyone who wants to cover the sun with a sieve and avoid their own responsibility will say: she was fat. It was. So what? Why did he “deserve” to die? Speech like that didn't just violate Tine, who, unfortunately, is already dead. They rape me too. And they add up to a growing lack of faith in life. How can I continue to exist in a world that kills my peers and makes fun of it all the time? Crying for Tine and not moving a muscle to make my existence more palatable doesn't change anything. I wonder how to not go crazy with this pain?
> 
> May Tine's faith in art also be our faith in life and in our accountability for her murder. May we not wash our hands - which, oh well, look at that, are quite dirty with transphobia and fatphobia - in the sinks of tributes that are forgotten in a few months or in the finger-pointing at those who will "make money" from her work. May we put those same hands on our conscience and think: what are we doing to avoid killing other people who are as important to us as Tine.
> 
> For me personally saying, Tine represented an amazing body in the world. Knowing that I was unable, in some way, to prevent her from being murdered and that, in some way, I contributed to it, gives me an unprecedented and deep pain. It pains me to know that we will no longer celebrate Carnival, in the block that welcomed our dissent in such a beautiful way. It pains me to know that we will no longer exchange impressions about bodies, about new songs, about song lyrics, about what they stir and move in structures, about silly things and funny things. It hurts to know that everything is a memory and whatever my memory is capable of reaching and creating from that. It hurts to know that the great act of a body is to exist and that Tine was very stubborn about it. She insisted. She named. She caught up. She jumped into life in drag. It was a platform for dignity (albeit for a short time).
> 
> I wanted to have written a tender text, talking about our carnivals, our happy bodies, in the block, in rehearsals, in life. I wanted to write a text about the soirées, about the first time I saw Tine assembled, I wanted to write a text about our outings, our meetings in this life, about how much I teased her and she never gave me morals. I wanted to write a text about the greatness of someone who, despite being afraid, existed. I wanted to tell the friend that I missed. From the gigantic artist that the city lost. I wanted to laugh at seeing her in the coffin with the dress that Paulinho didn't let you wear in the block because he had already made a costume, I wanted to laugh, with Tine, at the scene of the secretary of culture adjusting the LGBTQIA+ flag on the banner over the coffin, I wanted to say that it was a beautiful ceremony, with drumming, as it should be. I wanted to say that we did everything to ensure that gender identity was respected. I just wish life had been kinder to an existence. I wish people had been kinder.
> 
> I wish there was more time in this world for us to spend with people we identify with and for us not to be swallowed up by the obligation to make money all the time, to deliver a performance that is so unexciting. I wish so much. But above all, I wish I didn't have to write this text, which contains so much anger - and love, for having seen someone so incredible leave so soon, become a painful statistic, and no longer be able to be with us at all carnivals. I just wish I didn't have to conclude that my friend didn't die, she was killed. And that we all neglected the existence that we miss so much today.

> Go, Tine, color the sky with brushwork and your colors. With love and fury, Jéssica Balbino.
