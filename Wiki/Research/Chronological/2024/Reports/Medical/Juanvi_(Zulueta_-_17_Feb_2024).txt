> Juan Vicente Garabito Sánchez, the oldest trans person in Cuba and an icon of the LGBTIQ+ community on the island, died this Saturday at the age of 98 in the town of Zulueta, province of Villa Clara.
> 
> The death of Juanvi, as he was known in the entertainment world and among those close to him, was confirmed to Martí Noticias by journalist Maykel González Vivero.
> 
> "We met in 2018. They told me about a person who did drag and who was also very old, he was 93 years old at that time," commented the reporter, who keeps all that material as part of the memory of the LGBTQ+ community in Cuba.
> 
> Juanvi was a drag queen for more than six decades, since she began her artistic career in 1958 as Doris del Mar, in a show promoted by the Color Society.
> 
> “I think Juanvi leaves us a great lesson, his life. There are people who have even argued on social networks following his death, whether he was a drag queen or whether he was a trans person: Juanvi told me and I was reviewing the testimony, 'I was always a woman.' Of course, in his town she couldn't be that woman fully. She was from time to time, she went on stage as Doris del Mar, and in a time of state discrimination, of institutional discrimination, having survived that and never having lost her beauty and good character is admirable,” said González Vivero.
> 
> “The most extraordinary thing is that all this happened in a small town in the Cuban countryside, in Zulueta, a place where you don't expect it to happen. "It is an expression of art that you assume is typical of big cities and that in a small town it would never be well received, but Juanvi managed to do it and also earn the respect of his neighbors, the respect of the townspeople," he highlighted. the communicator.
> 
> In 2017, Garabito Sánchez received a tribute at the same cinema where he worked as a box office attendant. Months before he had performed at the El Mejunje cultural center, in Santa Clara, with the project “Yo me incluyo”.
> 
> “Juanvi was a beautiful person. A delicate person, very respectful and was even part of the Christian Church. That is, he was this person perceived as 'decent' and what he said was that he never suffered, let's say, open discrimination, although of course, he also respected the rules of his time and did not have any public sexual affectionate relationship. “Those were the norms and guidelines of the time,” he indicated.
> 
> The Camagüeyan drag queen Adriam García also remembers Garabito as "a trans person, very special and very loved by everyone, very good people. He told many stories from his youth and all the bad and good things that happened for being trans in Cuba."
> 
> “He told us that he did his private shows, that is, very private, because that was very persecuted at that time and very frowned upon by authorities, who persecuted homosexuals a lot. Great cultural personalities, writers, actors, painters and even politicians, were sent to the UMAP (Military Production Assistance Units). On many occasions Juanvi was detained and mistreated by the police,” García recalled.
