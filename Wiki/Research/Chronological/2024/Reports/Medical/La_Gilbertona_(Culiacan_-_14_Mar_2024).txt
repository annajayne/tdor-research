> Gilberto Salomón Vásquez, better known as La Gilbertona, died this Thursday, March 14, at the age of 88 in Culiacán, Sinaloa. Rumors had been spreading since the previous week that the transvestite influencer , with more than three million followers on Tik Tok, had died. “Everyone has to die, not just one,” he came out to deny the whispering, although with words that already sounded like a farewell. La Gilbertona achieved fame for her particular way of expressing herself, full of metaphors, colloquial language, uncensored and always direct. “Did you work in the United States?” asked Pepe Garza, producer and radio programmer. “No, I worked in prostitution,” he replied bluntly.
> 
> The news of his death was announced by his representative Pavel Moreno in a video published on the influencer's official Facebook page. “Pleasures, Gilberto died about an hour ago. Now they can say that Gilberto died. He will be buried at the Moreh funeral home here in Culiacán, Sinaloa.” The video was published around 10 in the morning and has almost 400,000 views. A week ago, when his followers were concerned about a video in which the influencer appeared lying down, Moreno confirmed that La Gilbertona had pneumonia, but was stable.
> 
> Gilberto Vásquez was born on January 11, 1936 in Guamúchil, Sinaloa. At 12, he moved to Culiacán, the city where he lived most of his life . From a very young age he dedicated himself to prostitution, but not out of necessity. “It was something I liked,” he often commented on the talk shows he attended. He never married, but he lived with a boy for a year and 8 months in the United States, but in 1988 he returned to Sinaloa, La Gilbertona said on the YouTube program, Entrevista2 .
> 
> Fame did not come to him with TikTok. Since Facebook was the social network that dominated the attention of Internet users, Gilberto's personality began to stand out. La Gilbertona became a fundamental part of the LGBT+ community for making diversity visible among older adults, a sector that is generally forgotten. At least 9% of adults in 30 countries identify as LGBT+, according to a survey conducted by Ipsos between February and March 2023.

> “Usually when we think of older people in the social imagination, we think of a man and a woman, over 60 years old, heterosexual, who live in a traditional family structure, who are grandmothers and grandfathers, who have retired, middle class. and who live in urban contexts,” reads a bulletin published by the Government of Mexico City, “however, this representation is only one of the many ways in which old age is characterized; On the contrary, there are older people with very diverse identity realities and who live in varied social contexts.”
> 
> Samantha Flores, an 88-year-old trans woman, created the first for older adults in Latin America who belong to the community. On her Instagram page, her description reads that all her services, such as psychological help or medical care, are free. She is in Xola 184b in the Álamos neighborhood. “We serve as a community center, because we create community and we are creating links between the community and those who live around it. That has been the most beautiful thing about the project,” Vincent C. Shwahn, project leader along with Samantha, told Animal Político in 2019.
