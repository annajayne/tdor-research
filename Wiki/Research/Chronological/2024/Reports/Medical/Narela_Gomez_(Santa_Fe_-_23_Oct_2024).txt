> This Wednesday, Argentine sport and society were shaken by the death of Narela Gómez, who at 30 years old left an indelible mark as the first trans soccer player in the Santa Fe League and as the first trans woman to join the provincial Police. According to local media, Narela had been facing a serious lung health problem for weeks that worsened in recent days, culminating in her death.
> 
> The news was confirmed by Viviana Servidio, General Secretary of Women's Football of the Santafesina League, through local media La Diez. Gómez had reached a historic milestone in 2021, when she debuted at Club San Cristóbal, becoming the first trans player on a team in the league. Her career made notable progress the following year, when she achieved promotion to the top category with her team.
> 
> Throughout his life, Narela became a symbol of struggle and perseverance, both in sports and in the Santa Fe Police. The Professional Police Association (Apropol) dedicated an emotional statement to him: “We regret to report the sad news that has caused great pain throughout the force... he leaves a deep mark due to his personality and way of being, appreciated and respected .” The entity highlighted the inspiring spirit of Narela, who always promoted acceptance and the value of diversity: “He told us: 'Be what you want to be. If you have a dream, follow it.'”
> 
> Gómez described herself as a fulfilled woman at peace with her life, something she shared in a previous interview: “ If I have to die today, I will die happy because I did everything I wanted. I do what I want with my life and I succeeded. And if I am born again, I would like to be Narela again .” This legacy of courage and authenticity is what her family, friends, colleagues and the entire Santa Fe community will remember today.
