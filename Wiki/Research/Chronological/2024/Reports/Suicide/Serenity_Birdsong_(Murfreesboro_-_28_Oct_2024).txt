> Trans student leader kills self in campus library
> Serenity Birdsong was vice president of the campus LGBTQ+ group. Then a 'darkness snuffed out her light.'
> By Daniel Villarreal Tuesday, October 29, 2024
> 
> Serenity Birdsong, a transgender student at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), killed themselves on Monday inside the campus’ James E. Walker Library. Birdsong was vice president of MTSU’s student LGBTQ+ organization MT Lambda.
> 
> The school canceled classes and closed the library on Tuesday but resumed normal operations on Wednesday. Additional details about Birdsong’s suicide have neither been made publicly available nor reported by the media.
> 
> “Serenity was more than an officer to us; many of us considered Serenity our friend, and her ability to light up a room, paired with her wholesome demeanor, made her welcome anywhere, but especially in Lambda where we are burdened by the darkness of existing in a world so often cruel to us. And it is this darkness that snuffed out Serenity’s light,” MT Lambda wrote in a Tuesday afternoon Instagram post marking Birdsong’s suicide.
> 
> The group had planned on hosting a Halloween party on Wednesday but instead will host a discussion and grieving space for people in memory of Birdsong. Additionally, the Student Government Association will hold a vigil on Wednesday at 6 p.m. local time in front of the campus library. The MTSU campus publication has also highlighted the availability of counseling services for students.
> 
> Additionally, an individual calling themselves Zoe Grummons organized a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign for Birdsong’s partner Delanie Dempsey.
> 
> “Both Serenity and Delanie have no other close family- they were family to each other. As Delanie grieves this loss she is left reeling with the emotional and financial implications of losing her partner. We want to provide her with the time and space to grieve without the burden of financial stress,” the campaign states.
> 
> As of Tuesday evening, the campaign has raised $12,755 of its $15,000 goal.
> 
> MT Lambda’s post memorializing Birdsong included a poem written by her.
> 
> The poem read, in part, “The trouble of life both big and small / seem to fade as the obstacles falls. / Now we embark on a new adventure / one with which we may joke and gesture. / But all in all, that which I hope most / is that I spend time with those I love, before I’m a ghost.”
