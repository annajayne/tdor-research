> Today, I want us to remember 22-year-old Megan Jordan Kridli. She was a friend, collaborator, and powerhouse Palestinian trans youth organizer. I first met her last year when she invited me to speak at her university. Her insightfulness, activist skills, and brilliance immediately blew me away. She organized with numerous groups between her college genders and sexualities club to an international social justice publication - all before the age of 18! She had so much to look forward to with community organizing and beginning her PhD in computer science. Trans youth shouldn’t have to have these accomplishments to be remembered, but I can’t overlook how she unapologetically made her mark on the world.
>  
> We spoke often as things got worse between the Palestinian genocide and the anti-trans rhetoric circulating across the country. I invited her to collaborate on some projects a few months ago, but she didn’t have time as her work and pressure ballooned. I did not know how straining it all was. She ended her life right after the anniversary of the genocide, the same month her senator promised to ban healthcare for trans girls like her. As we remember Megan’s contributions to the community, we cannot forget that trans youth are real people. They deserve celebration, support, and life. They deserve unconditional love for who they are.
