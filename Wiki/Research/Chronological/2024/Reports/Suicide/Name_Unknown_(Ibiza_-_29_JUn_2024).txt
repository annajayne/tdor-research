> Without criminal evidence
> Although several eyewitnesses claimed that someone had intentionally thrown the young woman from the flat, located at 4 Calle de Porreres , the first investigations by the Judicial Police of the Civil Guard indicated that it was a possible suicide.
> 
> The Civil Guard's Peripheral Communications Office (OPC) reported in the days following the incident that there were no criminal indications, as the body did not initially show signs of violence. Agents have been investigating the causes of death to clarify the events since the death occurred.
> 
> The Third Court of Instruction has also taken charge of the case. After collecting the first testimonies from people close to the victim and other witnesses, who indicated that the young woman jumped because she feared she was pregnant, the coroner verified during the autopsy whether she did indeed have another life inside her.
> 
> At that time, they discovered at the Institute of Legal Medicine that the patient was a transsexual woman (biological male) who had undergone a dangerous and highly unprofessional operation on her reproductive organs in Argentina, which had left her with very serious after-effects due to malpractice.
> 
> The victim was a foreign citizen (her origin has not been disclosed to this newspaper) who was estranged from her family and who lived on the island. It is also unknown whether the deceased was under the influence of alcohol or drugs when she fell out of the window. At the moment, the court is still waiting to send the evidence to the toxicology institute to draw conclusions in that regard.
> 
> Repatriation of the body
> The victim's relatives contacted the non-governmental organisation Metges del Món in Ibiza (which works with women in prostitution) to ask them if they could take charge of repatriating the young woman's body to her country of origin, as representatives of this association from the Balearic Islands explained to this newspaper.
> 
> The organisation added that, although they try to provide social assistance in these cases of vulnerability, they do not currently have the financial resources necessary to carry out this procedure.




> Death in Platja d'en Bossa: the woman who fell from a second floor was a trans woman who worked in an illegal brothel
> The lifeless body of the person was found in underwear and neighbors alerted the authorities last Saturday.
> 
> Civil Guard officers investigating the death of a woman who jumped from an apartment block in Platja d'en Bossa last Saturday have determined that the woman was a trans woman who was being sexually exploited . The person's lifeless body was found in her underwear and neighbours alerted the authorities.
> 
> The woman is believed to have jumped from the second floor of the apartment block called Géminis, in the municipality of Sant Josep, after suffering a nervous breakdown. She was with other prostitutes, according to information provided this morning by Diario de Ibiza.
> 
> Investigators have determined that the victim was between 20 and 30 years old, was a foreigner and her body showed no signs of violence, so the main hypothesis is that it was a suicide. Apparently, there is an illegal brothel there, where this trans woman worked.
> 
> In addition, the trans woman had undergone a sex change operation in Argentina that left her with serious after-effects due to malpractice, according to Diario de Ibiza.
> 
> Meanwhile, the Third Court of Instruction is awaiting toxicology results to determine whether the woman was under the influence of alcohol or drugs when she fell from the second-floor window.
