> On November 5th, 2024, Sydney Leigh Phillips passed away from suicide. She was living in East Islip, NY, USA. She was born July 31st, 2002. I personally didn't know Sydney, but her life was shared with me from a member of the community that was close to her. I believe she attended the University of Rhode Island. I will include the link to the obituary page. No obituary is listed, but the kind words shared by friends I think can speak far more of her kind-hearted nature and the love she had for others.
