> Trans Teenager Dead, Presumed to Have Jumped From Noyo Bridge
> 15 year old Naomi Lily Anne Mora, AKA Roy Mora, was labeled a male by police in their missing persons announcement
> Jan 27, 2025
> Naomi Lily Anne Mora was a 15 year old transgender- identifying high schooler living in Fort Bragg, California.
> 
> Naomi was recorded by a surveillance camera entering Noyo Bridge alone around 7 PM on December 7th. She did not leave the bridge from either exit. A passer-by, not suspected to be involved in Naomi’s death, found her phone several hours later on the bridge and turned it on. This metadata was recorded at 2 am.
> 
> Police erred on the side of respecting gender gremlins and called Naomi a male in the missing persons’ announcement.
> 
> In the end, it did not matter, because Naomi was ultimately identified through dental records due to advanced state of decomposition when she was found after 2 weeks in the water.
> 
> Somehow, even though her phone was found on the bridge, they needed to call in the psychics to find her.
> 
> Although the official cause of death has not been published, Naomi’s Tiktok friends who attended the funeral are calling it a suicide. It is unknown at this time whether she had begun taking testosterone or puberty blockers.
> 
> Rest in peace, Naomi.
