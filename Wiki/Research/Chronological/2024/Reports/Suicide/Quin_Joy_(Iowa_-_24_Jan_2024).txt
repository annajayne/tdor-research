suicide


> Yesterday we learned that of one of our trans sisters, Quin, died from suicide. By the end of her life, she was named Quin Joy, a testament to how hard she fought for personal happiness as a SA survivor. She was & should be remembered as a proud communist and feminist.
>
> She loved disco, queer cinema & queer literature canon, anime, jazz, hardcore, her friends, fighting games, & her cat Gray. Recently she was busy learning guitar, & was getting pretty good at it, & was working on music as a part of a band called Literature Club.
>
> I'll always remember that she fought incredibly hard to live after what happened to her. I hope that she's finally at peace. I'm going to miss her every day.
