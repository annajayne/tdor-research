> The letter published on social media to clarify the story of the boy who committed suicide at the hospital in Vizzolo Predabissi after being kidnapped
> Here the young man, after being left alone in a room on the fourth floor of the building, perhaps suffering from mental fragility due to the violence he had suffered, threw himself downstairs, committing suicide. After many articles about the story, the victim's friends decided to write and share a letter to clarify what happened.
> 
> The letter on the Vizzolo affair
> “We receive and share the letter of clarification on the death of the boy in the hospital of Vizzolo Predabissi on the evening of the 28th”. With this incipit, the letter written by the friends of the young victim, who wanted to clarify what happened in recent days , was published on social media, from the page Collettivo_kasciavit.

> A few hours before his death, Claudio Manara shared a post on Facebook in which he showed his bitterness for the last assembly. The last words of the mayor of Corte Palasio

> “This morning the newspapers reported the death of our friend, which occurred on the evening of the 28th,” the letter begins. “After having presented himself at the emergency room of the Vizzolo Predabissi hospital in a state of mental fragility, he was raped by another patient .”
> 
> “After immediately reporting the incident to the staff, he was taken to the Mangiagalli hospital, where injuries consistent with abuse were confirmed.” The boy, the letter continues, “was taken back to the hospital where the violence had occurred for social shelter, an emergency measure for people who have nowhere to go to be safe. Shortly after, he threw himself from the fourth floor, dying instantly .”
> 
> The questions and the errors
> “Despite the fact that he was a trans boy whose male pronouns were clearly indicated on his social profiles, all the newspapers called him 'woman' and referred to him with his old female pronouns. We have many questions about what happened, ” the letter continues. And in fact, initially the newspapers, unaware of some information, reported the news incorrectly, referring to the victim as female.

> Manager who was raped on Milan's Navigli was fired. The company: "You are no longer efficient"
> She was the victim of rape on the Navigli in Milan. After the trauma, the manager was fired because she was "no longer efficient"
> 
> The young victim's friends rightly wonder how it is possible that such violence could have occurred "in a protected place like a hospital" , why the young man was left alone despite "a traumatic event and a difficult and well-documented psychiatric history" and, above all, why the boy died "alone and without protection".
> 
> An event from which errors and carelessness emerge that can obviously hurt those close to what happened. Also for this reason the letter ends with the request for clarification on the dynamics of the event that, hopefully, can occur as quickly and correctly as possible.
