> The doctor says earlier this month, he was told news no one should have to hear.
> 
> “Two police officers from the Calgary Police Service arrived at my home and asked to speak to me and told me that my nephew — my trans nephew who lives in Edmonton — had died,” Keegan recalled. “They gave me the info to contact the Edmonton Police Service directly to learn more, and that’s when I learned he’d died by suicide.”
> 
> He says the rise of anti-trans hate had made his 37-year-old nephew feel scared and isolated, and claims hateful comments and discourse generated following the introduction of policies in February pushed him over the edge.
> 
> “The policy announcement by Danielle Smith was a piece of — not the only thing — but a clear contributor to his decision,” Keegan said.
> 
> Keegan said he and other advocates have warned the new transgender policies would lead to death.
> 
> “This shouldn’t have happened, it was chosen,” he said. “She knew this would happen.”
> 
> Earlier this month, Smith announced new rules on transgender and gender identity in Alberta, including directions around naming, sexual education, transgender athletes in women’s sports, and gender-affirming care.
> 
> If passed, Alberta will require parental consent for students 15 and under who want to change their names or pronouns at school. Students 16 and 17 years old won’t need consent, but their parents will have to be notified.
> 
> Parents must also opt-in for their kids to participate in each class that teaches about sex education, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
> 
> Current laws allow parents to opt-out of such education.
> 
> Gender reassignment surgery will also be banned for those 17 and under, the premier said, and minors won’t have access to puberty blockers and hormone therapies for gender reassignment or gender affirmation.
> 
> For transgender adults, Smith says her government is putting together a private registry of doctors and medical professionals who specialize in transgender surgery, which she says will better support the lifelong health care needs of transgender Albertans, including access to needed hormones and surgery aftercare.
> 
> Keegan says this is about basic human rights.
> 
> “I think people get really up in arms about compassionate stuff, but compassion is real,” Keegan said. “Every single person in Alberta deserves to live. Every single person in Alberta deserves to be here. Every single person deserves their medical conversations to be with their physicians and to be private and to be without the intrusion of politics.”
> 
> In a statement to CityNews, the premier’s office wouldn’t say if Smith would meet with Keegan to hear his concerns about the policies.
> 
> “Sudden loss of a family member is devastating and tragic for families, friends, and loved ones,” Smith’s office said in an email. “Mental health is a very serious issue and if you’re struggling please know that support is available to you no matter where you live in the province, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For those who need support, call or text 2-1-1 or call the Mental Health Help Line at 1-877-303-2642 for support, information and referrals to services. The Kids Help Phone can also be reached at 1-800-668-6868.”

> 
> "It's it's late and it's been a horrible two days. The short version is two nights ago, two members of the Calgary Police Service came to my home and asked to come inside and speak with me, and that's when I learned that my trans nephew had died by suicide.
> 
> "As a rational person, as a just a person in our world, and also as a family doctor, I sort of figured that there's a reasonable chance that these horrible policies that were unveiled in that disgusting video by Premier Smith probably didn't help.
> 
> "And yesterday I learned that they not just didn't help, that they were a contributing cause, that my trans nephew had been worried for quite some time and actually had messaged me in the past about concerns about the growing trend case in the United States and in Canada, but that specifically he was very scared and felt quite isolated as a direct result of Premier Danielle Smith unveiling of her planned policies... 
> 
> "The reason he's dead: Well, it's complex, but a direct contributing factor was the announcement by Premier Smith. And so you said earlier in the show it's only a matter of time before some people die as a result or start to get hurt as a result of her policies that she unveiled.
> 
> "And my nephew was 37, so not a kid or teen anymore. But still we now have at least one person death, which we can directly draw a line to to Premier Smith and the kind of hate that she and Pierre Poilievre and their ilk are promoting. 
> 
> "I also blame or think other people who are accountable are all of those every single UCP MLA who's sitting in caucus who was quite happy to let their leader choose hate, choose cruelty, because remember, it was something like ten years ago or so when she stood up as a member of the Wildrose Party and talked about the need actually to protect and provide opportunities for people who are trans. And she took a libertarian framework or perspective on it, as I recall. 
> 
> "And yet here she is now spewing hate, pretending to care when actually unveiling a horrible series of things which are setting back not just trans rights, but actually the rights of children to learn about their own bodies and sexual health is the most regressive set of such policies any of us have seen in Canada.
> 
> "Sadly, they're not the most regressive in the world, but boy, they're trying to get there. And this was all deliberate. She's not ignorant. She knew ten years ago what the right thing was. She's chosen cruelty. She knows and knew that people would be harmed, that people would die. And now she's got what she planned. There's no way a Premier can unveil that set of things, though, that sort of restrictions and prejudices and pretend to know or pretend to think that people won't get hurt.
> 
> "She knew this was going to happen. She knew it. And all I'm doing is just saying she got what she planned. My nephew's death. 
> 
> "All I know is that the premier of our province, the leader of our province and the UCP MLAs were all sitting there and allowing her to have that title. They are fully 100% on board with choosing cruelty, choosing death to stay in power, to accrue power to control people. They like the control. They they seem to like the cruelty because every single one of them knew this was going to happen, every single one of them.
> 
> "And it's not just them. It's also, you know, the premier of New Brunswick happily had a revolt, the premier of Saskatchewan in his caucus, and Pierre Poilievre and his caucus, all every single one of those elected people... every single one of them is just fine with exactly what they're leaders are saying, which is exactly opposite to freedom...
> 
> "This was a horror that was chosen. That's the key thing. This was a horror that was chosen by our premier and inflicted upon my nephew. And it continues to be inflicted upon anybody who's trans, anybody who has trans people in their family and anybody who's decent.
> 
> "This was chosen. And so it doesn't stop here. Now, none of us should have to actually think, well, what's next? Am I next? Is the group that I'm in next. None of us should actually have to ask that because this is just plain wrong anyways. But it's not going to stop here. We all know that there was that survey about underage abortions circulating the robo-survey or whatever was the same night as the video.
> 
> "We know that they're not stopping here. And where does this lead? I mean, we all know where it leads. It leads to a state that's controlling people. 
> 
> "And so anybody who's listening or either live or you're recording and you're sort of actually are not certain about trans people and what rights they should have and so on. And maybe you're thinking that maybe Danielle Smith is on to something or whatever, and you start thinking, 'Well, maybe actually those parent rights do make sense,' and so on.
> 
> "No, just the answer to the fear and anger and pain that you might have is not to hate on another group is to channel all the fear, the hate and pain you might be feeling into thinking, well, if I'm in pain, if I fear, if I'm angry or sad, I should channel that into thinking, 'How do I make this a better place?'
> 
> "The bottom line is, anybody who's seduced like, don't let yourself be seduced. If you have pain, fear, anger, sadness, don't let yourself be seduced and to hate on another group instead channel that into thinking, 'Well, how do we make this a better place for everyone?'
> 
> "Because there are a lot of people, as we know, who are thinking, 'Well, maybe there is something there.' But the the yardstick should be anybody who is seeking to restrict rights and particularly anybody like the Premier who is wanting to interfere in the direct relationship doctors like me have with our patients. Like anybody here on the phone, call perhaps, or anybody else.
> 
> "Once you hear a government wanting to get in the way of medical care, just know they're not doing this for the right reasons. It's all about control. So anybody who's thinking Danielle Smith might be right on this - she's not, and maybe you've got pain, anger, sadness or fear,... but do something else with that. 
> 
> "Channel it to good, not to evil, hate - on trans people."
