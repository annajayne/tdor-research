> Enquiry via https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/pages/contact from: Niko Stone (niko.stone@outlook.com) Organisation: Prismatic Joy Hello, It is with a really heavy heart that I reach out to let you know about someone from my local community we lost. A trans woman in Denver Colorado, Leah Jo, committed suicide on October 25, 2024. She had just recently turned 37 and has left a gap in the hearts of a lot of the queer community in this part of town. She was from North Hampton, Massachusetts and graduated from UMass Amherst. She had a political science degree. I did not know Leah personally but a lot of folks in my circle were also in hers. She was a loving friend and cared deeply for other people and for her world. She will be missed.
