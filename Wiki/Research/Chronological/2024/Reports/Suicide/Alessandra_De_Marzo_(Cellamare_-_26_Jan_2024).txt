> Trans found dead in her pet shop, Cellamare mourns Alessandra. The Mayor: “Forgive us world”
> January 26, 2024
>  
> “A point of reference for our community, especially in the world of our four-legged friends. She is always available, ready, altruistic. I can hardly believe it”. This is how the post published on social media by the mayor of Cellamare, Gianluca Vurchio, begins. The entire country mourns Alessandra, found lifeless this morning by her relatives in her pet shop. It seems to be a suicide but the body remains at the disposal of forensic medicine.
> 
> “I struggle to accept the sad news. The Cellamare community, today, is deeply shocked by the terrible news. We gather around his family, united in deep sorrow. Goodbye Ale, may the earth be light on you and may this world forgive us”, added the mayor. There are hundreds of comments and messages of condolence from friends and acquaintances. Alessandra was a trans and everyone describes her as a “great person, always available”. “A truly sensitive, good, altruistic person and also always smiling and joking, but evidently behind that smile there was a lot of pain”, the thought left by an acquaintance on social media.
