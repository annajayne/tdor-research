JMBF believes that Radia Teherin Utsha's death is a sobering reminder of the human cost of prejudice and discrimination. We should honor her memory by redoubling our efforts to create a society where all people are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity.

> JMBF learned from its reliable sources that Radia Teherin Utsha, a 19-year-old transgender model, tragically ended her life by jumping from the sixth-floor roof of Byatikram Mahila Hostel in Mirpur, Dhaka. Radia, a student in the honors first year at Mirpur Bangla College, took this drastic step on April 22, Monday, around 8:00 PM.

Additionally, Radia was subjected to further torment by some individuals within the transgender community in Dhaka.

He said, "the devastating loss of Radia Teherin Utsha serves as a poignant reminder of the profound challenges faced by transgender individuals in our society. Her untimely demise underscores the urgent need for greater awareness, acceptance, and support for the transgender community, as we collectively strive for a more inclusive and compassionate world."
