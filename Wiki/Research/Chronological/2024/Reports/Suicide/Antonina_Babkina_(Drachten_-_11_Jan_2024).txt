> The parents of 25-year-old asylum seeker Antonina Babkina, who took her own life in the asylum center in Drachten, are waiting for their child's body to be 
> 
> The parents told the Russian news agency IA Regnum that they support the law banning transgender transition in Russia. The law came into effect on July 24, 2023 .
> 
> They say they were against their child, whom they consistently call their son, wanting to leave Russia. "I was categorically against my son leaving for Europe," says 54-year-old father Andrei Nikolaevich.
> 
> According to 47-year-old mother Anna, their son had mental health problems since childhood and was bullied by peers. She attributes their child's desire to transition to mental illness and a lack of appropriate treatment.
> 
> 'My son was mentally ill and had been diagnosed since he was a child. What gender change can we talk about? Someone with an intellectual disability cannot have their gender changed anywhere in the world. If someone wants to become Napoleon, they treat him, but if a boy wants to become a girl, why don't they treat him?! In Russia, someone gave him a passport in a woman's name for money, but in fact my son was and remained a man to the end. He carried out the operation neither in Russia nor in Europe,” says Anna Igorevna.
> 
> 'My son was bullied by his peers since he was a child, maybe that's why it all happened. But I think it is good that there is now a law in Russia that prohibits gender change. If he had stayed in Russia, maybe they could have helped him and he could have put aside these thoughts about changing gender,” says Antonina's mother.
> 
> The family is now trying to bring the body back to Russia for burial. 'We want this all to end quickly and to bury our son at home in Russia. But so far no one is in a hurry to tell us anything,” explains Anna Igorevna.
> 
> Antonina Babkina became popular on the Internet thanks to a photo he published as Anton in 2014. Other internet users used his face, changing clothes, hairstyles and captions. Antonia only discovered three years later that her portrait had been misused. Her identity was also shared on the Internet, which led to a flood of messages from strangers, some sending new versions of his photos, but there were also those who wrote insults and threats to the teenager. 
> 
> In 2019, Antonnia announced online that she considers herself a girl and later announced that she planned to have her gender changed. Antonnia talked on Twitch about problems with her mother, who threatened to throw her out of the house.




> What is behind the suicides of LGBTQ+ people in refugee camps in the Netherlands? · Global Voices in Portuguese
> 
> This article was originally published in Holod magazine . An edited version was republished on Global Voices through a content partnership agreement.
> 
> In mid-January, it was reported that Antonina Babkina, a Russian transgender girl who had been granted asylum, committed suicide in the Netherlands. This marks at least the fourth reported case of suicide among Russian-speaking refugees in the country in the last year.
> 
> Your neighbors make a difference
> According to Sandro Kortekaas, a spokesperson for the Dutch organization LGBTQ Asylum Support , all suicide cases have one thing in common: the victims did not receive psychological support in time. Kortekaas said, “Most refugees come from countries with a large number of problems. Ideally, there should be a medical assessment as soon as they arrive in the Netherlands and another before the refugee interview.”
> 
> Kortekaas pointed out that the lack of attention given to LGBTQ+ asylum seekers is due to the large influx of refugees in the Netherlands. Temporary refugee camps essentially function as dormitories where new arrivals are housed in blocks with shared kitchens and bathrooms. There is no systematic planning for accommodation: individuals of various nationalities, religions and sexual orientations may share rooms. The camp administration needs to resolve serious conflicts. However, a Justice Department report showed that employees do not always respond appropriately to complaints.
> 
> LGBT Asylum Support is currently working to create blocks of rooms reserved just for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers in each camp.
> 
> For an even more conservative society
> Hina Zakharova applied for asylum in the Netherlands in December 2022. She lived in a camp in Drachten. It's important to note that Drachten, a small Dutch town in the northeast of the country, is much more conservative than Amsterdam.
> 
> Hina needed hormone replacement therapy, which has a long waiting list in the Netherlands, estimated at two years. The weight of these challenges became unbearable for Hina. She committed suicide. Residents of the camp in Drachtne said in refugee chats that Hina asked for help, but she received no support: “people either responded aggressively or mocked her desire to seek euthanasia.”
> 
>  War will teach you
> Anna, a transgender girl from Ukraine, was close to Katya Mikhailova, born in Moldova and who died 10 months after Hina: “in Katya's case, everything happened because of a specific official who made a formal decision [to deny asylum]. He saw that the girl was on the safe countries list and decided that the rest of Katya's case was irrelevant.”
> 
> Mikhailova lived in the small town of Bendery with her family. However, they did not accept her transgender identity and, after many beatings, she (with the help of the GenderDoc-M center) had to move to a temporary shelter.
> 
> “Moldova is quite intolerant, especially the Transnistrian region, as the local government copies all Russian laws,” explained Kholod Anzhelika Frolova, director of GenderDoc-M. In Bendery, Katya was forced to join the army. The girl underwent medical examinations and was “diagnosed” with transsexualism.
> 
> “It all ended with the military officer saying, 'We haven't received any documents from the hospital, so we're taking you,'” Frolova continued. After that, Mikhailova fled the country, and a criminal case was opened against her for evading military service.
> 
> Katya Mikhailova spent more than a year and a half in the Netherlands, trying to obtain refugee status. In December 2023 the denial was confirmed.
> 
> On December 25, Katya Mikhailova's body was discovered in the hallway of a refugee camp in the city of Heerlen.
> 
> As Global Voices reported earlier this year, Moldova recently denied refugee status to five citizens from the LGBTQ+ community. The General Inspectorate for Migration (IGM) responded to them that “mere belonging to a social group is not a reason” to have refugee status. The institution concluded that the country of origin does not pose a threat to the life and safety of the candidates. It is clear that these responses show ignorance of the realities faced by members of the LGBTQ+ community and a lack of understanding of the political context.
> 
> Behind bars
> Antonina Babkina committed suicide on January 11. She was known on social media for sharing reflections on her life. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she sought refuge in the Netherlands. At the time of her death, she had already received a residence permit and was living in a government-provided apartment.
> 
> “Antonina was diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. I asked the COA and doctors to consider her perspective,” says Sandro Kortekaas. “One problem overrode the other, and as a result she became a source of problems for them.”
> 
> Babkina was transferred to the Enforcement and Supervision Center (HTL) for refugees exhibiting serious anti-social behavior. The HTL is surrounded by a barbed wire fence, with guards and strict rules of coexistence compared to regular camps. Individuals at the center undergo a special behavioral correction program. According to Kortekaas, people with diagnoses like Antonina's shouldn't go to HTL because it could only make their mental health problems worse.
> 
> ' People don't understand where they are going '
> Little is known so far about the suicide of 24-year-old refugee Mikhail Zubchenko. According to LGBTQ Asylum Support, he applied for refugee status as a bisexual man from Russia.
> 
> The founder of the psychological assistance project Without Prejudice, Polina Grundmane, told Holod that many refugees need psychological help but cannot get it in time. Although there are experts available in the Netherlands, most of them speak Dutch, while newcomers to the country do not speak Dutch or English. “Unfortunately, people don't always understand where they are going,” explains Grundmane. “They leave their countries thinking that there is something much better here. Don’t expect that, when you arrive, everything will be according to your expectations.”
> 
> Bright or not so bright future
> Transgender girl Sasha, a friend of Katya Mikhailova, believes that the Netherlands is the most favorable country for LGBTQ+ refugees from Russia to seek asylum. If they are successful, the two years waiting will be worth it: the refugee receives an apartment to live in, financial support, the opportunity to study with favorable loans, and citizenship after five years of residence.
> 
> However, Salim Aleulov, a former neighbor of Mikhail Zubchenko, has a different view: potential refugees actually face problems that become factors for suicide, and which could have been avoided.
> 
> Research indicates that high risks of suicide exist among those living in refugee camps around the world. The main reasons are socioeconomic disadvantages, traumatic experiences, high levels of anxiety and depression, and limited access to medical help.
> 
> The number one cause of suicide is untreated depression. Depression is treatable, and suicide is preventable. You can get help from confidential support services for suicidal people and those in emotional crisis. Visit Befrienders.org to find suicide prevention support in your country.
