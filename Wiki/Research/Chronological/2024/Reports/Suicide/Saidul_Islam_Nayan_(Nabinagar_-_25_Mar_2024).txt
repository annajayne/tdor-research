> Transgender Individual committed Suicide in Nabinagar, Brahmanbaria Due to Mental Stress
> 
> On March 25, 2024, Saidul Islam Nayan (26) committed suicide by hanging himself in Darra village of Nabinagar upazila, Brahmanbaria. Nayan was the eldest of three sons of Md. Shariful Islam and Nargis Akhtar from Darra village in the Rasullabad union. It is known that he had been in Saudi Arabia for a long time.
> 
> According to family sources, although Nayan was biologically male, his behavior was akin to that of the third gender. Hijras are often ridiculed by locals for their affinity and feminine nature. Locals believe that he may have committed suicide due to social bullying and the inferiority complex associated with being a hijra. The Acting Police Inspector (OC) of Nabinagar Police Station stated that more details will be provided after the investigation.
