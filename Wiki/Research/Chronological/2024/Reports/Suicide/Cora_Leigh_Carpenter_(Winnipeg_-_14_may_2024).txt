>
> Hi there, Our friend Cora Leigh Carpenter died by suicide after dealing with extreme transphobia, sexual and physical assault, and homelessness. This was in Winnipeg, Manitoba and happened on May 14, 2024


> I get the impression that watching so many cis people rage and shed tears over the nightmareish lives that trans kids are forced to endure is supposed to fill me with something like hope or gratitude, but it sort of just makes me nauseous. 
> 
> Because I know what the trans kids who survive the abuse have to look forward to. When they're forced into endless suicidal ideation by cishets - usually males - who beat us, doxx us, call us pedophiles, isolate us socially, and cut us off from all support, the same people who are crying for dead trans kids now won't give two wet shits... or more likely, they'll straight up agree that we *deserve* humiliation, poverty, violence, isolation, and the constant threat of death for speaking the wrong words to the wrong man who was determined to be NiceTM by the cishet court of public opinion, or some shit...
> 
> Surviving was a mistake. I should have killed myself in a public bathroom as a kid. It's apparently the only way you people would have allowed my life to have any meaningful impact on your conscience
