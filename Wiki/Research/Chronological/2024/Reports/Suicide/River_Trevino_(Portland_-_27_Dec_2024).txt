I'll never forget when you came home with your mommy and Dad in a shoe box because you were too tiny to fit in a car seat. I was so excited to hold you but again you were so little that you fit in the palm of my hands. So I held your beautiful little body like a small toy. You just curled up like a small puppy. I will always carry all I mean all the Joy and memories you brought to me and Chloe and thank you for being Chloes #1 fan and Cousin and especially her favorite Cousin and babysitter!!! Me and your baby Chlo Chlo will always remember what you brought to our lives and hearts!! So go to heaven and chill with all our fallen loved ones!!! Until we meet again and I was fortunate to have you drive me to the homeless shelter and especially stopping and dollar tree with your mommy to get some chocolate chocolate_bar Milk for your #1
