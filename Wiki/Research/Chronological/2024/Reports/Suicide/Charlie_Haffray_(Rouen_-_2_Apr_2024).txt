> Enquiry via https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/pages/contact from: Cassandre (damanyuh@gmail.com) Organisation: FiertÃ©s ColorÃ©es, centre LGBTI+ Rouen Hello, I know they haven't been mediatized much, but two transmasc people committee suicide this year in France, in part because of transphobia.
> 
> One in Rouen on April 2 (Charlie Haffray, 26yo, transmasc, death report : https://www.libramemoria.com/defunts/haffray-charlie/da625f54f02b4b3a8aa9ff8a092a4817 there are no articles on his death but he was part of FiertÃ©s ColorÃ©es, the LGBTI+ center in Rouen. I can share a screenshot of the message his partner sent to the association announcing his death)
> 
> One in Saint-Nazaire on may 9 (Tris LassabliÃ¨re, 25yo, trans man, death report : https://www.libramemoria.com/defunts/lassabliere-tris/14695324b81f46fc86fbd3e13f41d673 ; article about his suicide : https://www.ouest-france.fr/societe/faits-divers/un-important-dispositif-engage-au-pied-du-pont-de-saint-nazaire-pour-retrouver-un-jeune-homme-08c4f90e-0ee0-11ef-9468-f1ca8c573b21 )

> Sorry, this is all in French. Tris was from Saint-Malo, but lived in Rouen. He drove to Saint-Nazaire because the bridge there is known for how many people commit suicide by jumping from it. I don't know how you treat the location info so I thought too much info was better than not enough. While Charlie's identity was respected during his ceremony, Tris' wasn't. Both their families made it clear they were against their transitions, and that's what ultimately pushed them. They were both close friends, and important activists in queer, trans, antifascist activism in Rouen. It's a big loss for the local community.

> I probably have pictures of them somewhere, if needed, I just need to look for them Sorry if anything is weirdly phrased, involuntarily rude or anything, English isn't my first language and I'm only self-taught (I particularly struggle with email greeting and ending formulas) Thank you for your very important work for the transgender community ðŸ™ðŸ¤ Sincerely, Cassandre.
