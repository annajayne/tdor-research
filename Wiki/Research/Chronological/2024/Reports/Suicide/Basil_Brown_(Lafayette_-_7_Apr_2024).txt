> A student committed suicide after alleged sexual assaults at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette.
> 
> Jeremy Basil Brown, a 21-year-old UL student, took their life on April 7, 2024. This occurred two days after Brown posted on their Instagram profile, @8asil00, who influenced their decision. 
> 
> In Brown’s last post, the photo has Brown standing in front of one of the parking towers in their “suicide fit.” 
> 
> Brown’s caption also provided a “[…] very abbreviated list of my rapists” including the names Chris Moody, Josh Brown, and Shawn R Popp. 
> 
> The day after the incident, UL sent out a public announcement that left students frustrated and uneasy. 
> 
> According to the @ul_whistleblower, an Instagram page used to share information and thoughts on UL matters, the university’s public announcement did not offer an appropriate response to Brown’s death. 
> 
> “[The university’s] response was to alienate the victim’s friends from offering any help or support to the victim, thereby isolating them […] This cowardly failure to say what happened not only perpetuated rumors that they were murdered or otherwise, but also further stigmatizes the reality that students struggle with suicidal thoughts,” UL Whistleblower said.
> 
> The UL Whistleblower continued by saying the resources the university Wellness and Testing center provide are “ineffective in preventing a preventable tragedy.”
> 
> John Desrette, a UL sophomore general studies student, said he arrived on campus about an hour after the incident. He said police swarmed around the parking tower and directed him towards another exit so as to not see Brown.
> 
> “I knew of [Basil] but didn’t know them personally. I know of the incident though. I was driving back to campus and saw cops everywhere in the parking tower. I drove up and parked, and when I walked down the stairs, I asked an officer what was going on. He claimed the area was closed off and I had to go the other way around. As I got to my room, I turned to Facebook and Snapchat and read about what was going on,” Desrette said.
> 
> Desrette said social media platforms did not aid in finding truth but instead spread rumors. He said that what happened is difficult to understand, but that if someone is going through a hard time, they should seek help.
> 
> If you or someone you know are experiencing thoughts of suicide or are just in need of mental health services, feel free to contact the Nicholls Counseling Center. 
> 
> You can call the center at (985) 448-4080 or drop by 224 Elkins Hall to schedule an appointment from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
> 
> For after-hours emergencies, call Nicholls University Police at (985) 448-4911.
> 
> The suicide and crisis lifeline number is 988 and is available 24 hours.





> Basil Brown was a magnetic person. His presence filled the room and could even make the biggest Debbie Downer smile.
> 
> It's what his friends and those who knew him remember most about the University of Louisiana at Lafayette student who died by suicide last week.
> 
> Those who interacted with Brown have only been able to recall positive experiences with the 22-year-old, said Malek Richard, who knew Brown through the UL band program.
> 
> “No one had anything bad to say about him. It was always, ‘man, this guy can walk into a room and fix everything immediately,’” the 19-year-old said. “He always had such a good outlook on life.”
> 
> Brown always “spoke up for the little guy,” Richard said, and was an advocate for the LGBTQ+ and disability communities.
> 
> Brown shined creatively. He was the “clarinet player with the fire fits,” a fellow band member told Richard about Brown and the outfits he would wear. He combined his knowledge of coding with his artistic eye to code a unique universe to life. It was his pride and joy. 
> 
> He had an affinity for tarot cards. Wren, whose last name is being withheld for privacy concerns, said they would spend hours together as Wren asked the same question in various ways: “Does this person like me?”
> 
> “He would just sit with me and talk it through with such patience and passion” Wren, a 20-year-old UL senior, said.
> 
> Preston Kyle met Brown at a philosophy club meeting, where Brown always had something interesting to say about the topic at hand. Kyle said he would always pick the disagreement side to keep the fight going but knows he and Brown had a lot of common ground.
> 
> “Now that he’s not there, you can feel the hole,” Wren said. “He was genuinely a presence in the room.”
> 
> But Brown’s friends have said they’ve barely had time to grieve. They’ve criticized the university for its handling of Brown’s death claiming it wasn’t transparent after Brown’s death leading to misinformation and more pain.
> 
> A group of about 200 students, staff and others gathered Monday afternoon near the UL student union to call on the university to change its welfare check protocol, update its emergency notification system, publicly acknowledge Brown's death and better staff its wellness center with more certified mental health personnel. 
> 
> Had the system been different, if it were better structured to support those struggling, Brown’s friends said they wouldn’t have to shoulder the responsibility to call for change.
> 
> “If (Basil) had been taken care of properly, Basil wouldn’t be in the place he was in,” Richard said. “When someone is (in that) situation, they’re not thinking rationally. There has to be someone to make the grand decision of ‘what do you need right now?’ instead of ‘what do you want?’”




> LAFAYETTE, La. (KADN) — UL police made contact with a student one day before they died by suicide on campus earlier this month. Records obtained by News 15 Investigates show that on the morning of April 6, campus police received a report of a concerning post by Basil Brown on social media.
> 
> A friend of Brown called UL police from Houma, indicating that Brown, who identified as transgender, posted to social media saying that they wanted to commit suicide. The caller indicated she could not provide copies of Brown's post because they were on Snapchat and had disappeared. 
> 
> Officers initiated a welfare check and tracked Brown's whereabouts on campus through the Cajun Card System. The system showed Brown had swiped their card to access their residence hall.
