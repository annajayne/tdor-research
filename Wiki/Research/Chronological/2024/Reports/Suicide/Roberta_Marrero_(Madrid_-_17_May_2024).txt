> Roberta Marrero lived and wrote in Madrid. That is what it said, essentially, but in the present, the brief biographical note of her last book, the collection of poems Derecho a cita (Continta me tú, 2024). This Friday the news of her death became known. Her friend and author of the epilogue to her latest book by ella, Inés Plasencia, has reported that the cause of her death by ella was suicide and that she left a note that said “I love you all.” there).

> To know the biography of Roberta Marrero, to know her, it is better than reading the flap of her books, or this obituary, it is better to read her work. Roberta was a green baby. This is how she told it in her magnificent book of handwriting and drawings of the same name (Lunwerg Editores / Planeta, 2016). She was born on March 2, 1972 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the youngest of three siblings. Two events marked her birth, she writes, one was that she was born green because she swallowed “things that women expel when giving birth” and the other event was that at birth everyone said it was a boy, “but no, it was a little girl".
> 
> One of his first family stories that he tells in The Green Baby has to do with his aunt Nina, the gravedigger, which reflects Marrero's love for sinister things: dark music, cemeteries, vampires, Jiménez del Oso, Oscar Wilde, Joy Division, Blavatsky , Bauhaus and terror. “I've always been a goth at heart!” I have exclaimed.
> 
> And so, Gothic-Hispanic, poetic, electronic, Europop, at the forefront of danger was his excellent album, although little known and unfindable on digital platforms, Claroscuro (Susurrando, 2007), with such moving songs, sung in his deep voice, like Human, too human. Until then, Roberta Marrero was known in the music scene as a DJ and her album, which was preceded by a promotional EP, precisely titled A la vanguard del danger (Susurrando, 2005), caused a sensation.
> 
> Pop saved his life, as he states in The Green Baby, and that happened the day he saw Boy George from Culture Club on Spanish television in 1983: “That day was a revelation, a mystical experience; “There were men who put on makeup and dressed in a feminine way.” The whisper in his ear from pop stars, from Steve Strange to Siouxsie, from Marc Bolan to Pete Burns, made him discover that he could dress as he wanted, be as he wanted, love as he wanted.
> 
> His first illustrated book was titled Dictadores (Ediciones Hidroavión, 2015). In a recent interview in elDiario.es , conducted by her friend Alan S. Portero, Roberta, described it as “a book that went very unnoticed” in which she used imagery that “would make her end up in court as soon as the police discovered it.” indicated person". The dictator Francisco Franco appeared on the cover with a Hello Kitty bow on his head. "Although I am attracted to provocation, it is not something conscious, I use what I use because it seems aesthetically interesting, beautiful, there is no political intention, although that same intention is already doing politics, I return again to punk," he explained. the artist.
> 
> Following some of the lines opened in The Green Baby, Marrero published in 2018 We Can We Heroes: A Celebration of LGTBQ+ Culture, in which, with reference to David Bowie's Heroes in the title, the author addressed the contribution of the LGTBQ+ collective to the culture of recent decades. On her cover, a myriad of faces, from Anohni Hegarty, Divine, García Lorca, Klaus Nomi or Genesis P-Orridge, absolute references for her.

> His first collection of poems appeared in the year 22, Everything was for being fire. Poems by pimps, trans and transvestites (Continta me, you have me), there he talked about the declassed and delved into the wound as a literary motif. She called it “dirty poetry,” as she explains in this interview in El Salto , and she defined the book as “street” and “outskirts,” in which they talked about “chulos” and “semen,” which in fact is the last one. word on the last page. “They are poems in which allusions are made to popular songs, not pop, by Rocío Jurado, by Mocedades, references to Pedro Lemebel, the street language of pimps, transvestites, razors,” she explained in that interview.
> 
> Marrero was an artist who based much of her art on being referential, generous with her genealogy. “I feel sorry for [what has happened to] this whole genealogy of the untamed, which does not only occur in queers, but also in transvestites on the street, in punk, in Emily Dickinson!, who was a wild woman and If we go back, Saint Teresa of Jesus was also a fierce woman. It's okay to want to accommodate, I have nothing against it, we don't all need to be untied but not bourgeois either, at least in terms of form. Indomitable people continue to exist, but they don't appear in the media, we appear because we speak well, because we are not whores, it is that horrible but it is like that, we are the good beasts," she told Alana S. Portero in elDiario.es ago just three weeks.
> 
> Right to Appointment has been her last published book, within a corpus in which she has created and exhibited many original works and has been a total artist, indefinable only by one of her facets. “Here is my corpse,” says the epigraph of the collection of poems, which now remains as a testament and farewell, mandatory reading for all those who admired her and also for those who did not know her. “If you find me dead / cover me with flowers, / put a diamond in my mouth, put a gold actress on my tits. / Take a photo of my corpse / and put it in a silver frame, / light a candle in my memory. / Tonight in this world / I will put on my makeup and comb my hair carefully.”

> “Here we are sadder and more boring, but in the limbo of poets a new superstar is already shining,” Inés Plasencia wrote when announcing her farewell.

> In her works as an illustrator, Roberta Marrero mixed and de-contextualized popular images, giving rise to new meanings, and using the technique of artistic appropriation. For example, in her first published book, Dictadores (2015), she transforms several photographs of icons of totalitarianism with images related to the pop world. She thus shows Mao Zedong surrounded by characters whose faces have been covered by Hello Kitty heads, and presents a portrait of Francisco Franco made up with a lightning bolt on his face, in the style of David Bowie on the cover of Aladdin Sane. With this publication, the artist stated that her intention was to "Vandalize a fascist message and turn it into another one of freedom."

In addition, she samples from the Fauvist movement, expressionism, surrealism, Catholic religious painting, classical Hollywood, and punk.

The designer and her husband Andreas Kronthaler responded that the image had been copied without knowledge that it was a work by a contemporary artist.
