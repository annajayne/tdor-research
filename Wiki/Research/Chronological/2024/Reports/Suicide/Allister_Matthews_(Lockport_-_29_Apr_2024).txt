> Allister Matthews - Lockport, IL Born: December 9th, 2006 Passed Away: April 29th, 2024 Allister tragically died by suicide on April 29th, 2024. He was 17 years old. Few details are known regarding Allister's passing, and unfortunately, his family misgendered him even in his death, his aunt going so far to do so at the candlelight vigil held by his peers. All available information regarding Allister's passing contains his deadname so I will not link it, he deserves so much more than that. I do not wish to receive credit for bringing this to your attention, but these were beautiful words from his best friend regarding who Allister was. "There are so many things that I could tell the world about Allister Matthews. I could tell you how he was never afraid to be himself. I could tell you how unapologetically unique he was from the way he dressed to the way he spoke. I could tell you how he had freckles on his cheeks and the bridge of his nose like little stars that I'd give tiny kisses to just to see him smile. I could tell you how he saw value in every life, no matter how small."

> You sat by my sister every day on the bus, you made her feel welcome and loved. She talked about you all the time, how excited she was to see you, asking what your name was. From the few moments I got the honor to speak to you, you were unbelievably sweet and enjoyable to be around. And I regret not knowing you as well as I should have. I owe you so much for being there with my sister. Thank you for being as sweet as you were to everyone, you mean a lot to me and my sister. I remember I saw you in the hall with different hair everyday with a different color, and I always became excited wondering how you would dress the next day. I looked forward to seeing you. May you rest in peace. ??????????

> Allister you were a person who marched to the beat of your own drum and didnt forfeit individually for the sake of fitting in. I respected that about you and the bravery needed to do it. I had conversations with I hope to never forget and I hope that wherever you are now you are happier than you were here.

> Allister Mckenzie Matthews was an amazing person and an even better friend. I didn’t know him as long as others did, but I knew him for enough years that he felt like a stable pillar in my life. I got the news of his passing from my guidance counselor, and when he told me, I didn’t think it was real or even possible. He was such a bright light and had promised me that he was doing better. Even though I vehemently denied the claim at the time, the very notion that my best friend was gone made something in my chest crack. I kept thinking that there was no way it was real; that it was just a bad dream. I struggled with abandonment before, but this was a whole new level that my heart was not prepared for. Even now it feels like I can’t breathe. Like there’s a weight on my lungs and my chest that has grown tighter. I feel like I’m being suffocated. I keep flipping between feeling the overwhelming crash of emotions in tidal waves too large to swim against, to feeling like I’m watching some kind of bad movie that isn’t real. It sometimes feels like he’s still at home watching Resident Evil videos and I can just drive over there right now to see him. I’d throw small pebbles at his window and steal him from home for an unexpected hang out. But regardless of whichever way I’m feeling, the pressure on my chest remains. There are so many things that I could tell the world about Allister Matthews. I could tell you how he was never afraid to be himself. I could tell you how unapologetically unique he was from the way he dressed to the way he spoke. I could tell you how he had freckles on his cheeks and the bridge of his nose like little stars that I’d give tiny kisses to just to see him smile. I could tell you how he saw value in every life, no matter how small. I could tell you how he would carry plushies to class and let people hold them if they were sad. I could tell you how he gave the Valentine’s chocolates I gave to him to other people who didn’t receive anything. I could tell you how he promised me that he would follow me anywhere in the world as long as I’d be there. I wish I had told him that the feeling had been mutual. But in the end, he went somewhere I couldn’t follow. I hope he’s waiting for me, at least. I hope he doesn’t mind. I still have things I need to do. I have people I need to watch over. I have stories I need to write. I have places I need to see. And I’ll tell him all about it when I see him again. I loved him so much. He was my everything. He was my best friend.

> I will miss you. I’m remember the days you went on my bus and all our friend group would talk about is our lives. I remember when you were in the port with us and you would hold iced coffee in one hand and your purple raven plushie in one hand named King. You always had the best outfits and I always wondered what your closest looked because I was so amazed by you. I remember your smile and your voice. I also remember you bowling in my friend Bivi’s birthday party wearing a black leather jacket. I wish I could have talked to you more. I will forever miss you my friend.

> I knew Allister for about a year, ever since I started visiting the library before school. He was by far the brightest, most confident kid I ever knew. Infinitely kind and brave, he did everything and anything in his own way. I remember the countless days I went to his house after school, where we would hang out for hours, watching TV shows and talking endlessly about everything going on around us. You stood as a bright light to everyone around you, and your endless energy inspired everyone. I remember the day we all visited Culver's together and just hung out and ate. My only wish is that I could've seen you more. Rest easy for me, until I get there with you. I love you endlessly.

> We haven’t talked in a while but were friends until freshman year. When someone told me you passed i didn’t know what to think, but I remembered all the times we hung out. We were friends for 5 years and hung out all the time, from doing nothing but sitting in your room to riding our bikes all over, getting food, anything. I honestly still don’t know what to think but it didn't register that you had passed on my birthday until yesterday, and that made me even more upset. I kept thinking back to everything we did together, and I hope you have a better time now than when you were alive. R.I.P. allister.

> I have only known Allister for abkut 5 months, and I would have liked to know him more. I have been his new neighbor for a few years since I moved, and recognized Allister as someone who isn't afraid to be look different, and i admired his tenacity. For the past 5 months I would go to Allister's house and spend a few hours with him almost every week. But for the past two months however, he had been pushing me out. I send my condolences to friends and family, but I know I will miss him, I will miss him a lot actually. Please, rest easy now Allister, and I hope you're happier, wherever you are. I am happy you let me into your life. And I enjoyed our time together.

> Allister, I'll never forget you. You made a long lasting impact on my Junior year and my only regret is not spending more time together than what we had. My favorite memory we had together was the rock climbing field trip we went on together for adventure ed.. I'm glad we all were able to share that memory. Everyone who I have talked to shares their sympathies.. We all miss you. You were an amazing person, Allister. I always looked forward to seeing you during lunch, in some ways I looked up to you man.. You always wore the best outfits, and I loved the music you listened to. I hope in the end you're happy, I'm so sorry this world was unfortunate to you.. Maybe one day, if we have faith, I'll meet you again on the other side. Thank you for effecting me in a positive way. Whether it was in history, lunch, or gym. You were a great friend to me, and many others.. thank you..

> Allister, I’m really going to miss you. Your amazing outfits, when we sometimes chatted in horticulture. I already miss your presence, and the empty chair at your desk kills me. We didn’t know each other that well but I hope your soul is at ease and you’re already being treated with kindness in the afterlife <3.

You are one of my bestest friends I have ever had I felt like I could talk to you about anything and everything and I appreciate you for giving me that feeling that not many people have given me. Miss you so so so much I love ya man ????

> I haven't known you for that long, I've only started talking to you since the beginning of second semester, and I certainly don't regret it. I'm glad that you saw my art and invited me to your cafeteria table. You helped me feel comfortable in a place where I wasn't. I hope I was a good friend to you, Allister. You were certainly a great friend to me. I'm so sorry the world treated you so poorly, and I hope now you are being treated better wherever you are.

> Allister you crazy bastard, there was never a dull moment with you around. You always had the best style, the best jokes, the best things to say to lift up everyone around you. It won't be the same without you, I'm gonna miss you so much. I hope wherever your soul is now is better than where it left behind.

> You crazy sonabitch, I cannot ever forget the day I met you. You never followed to anything anyone said. You were so bright and your smile was radiant. Never letting anyone see you suffer, being the silly person you always were. The world had no right to treat you this way. And no matter what, what you brought here and with us that graced you will never be let go and forgotten. I love you Allister and I hope now your soul is at ease. ??

> You were a great friend. I remember going to dellwood nearly every single day with you and tord. My favorite memory of you is when we shared a pair of broken ear buds while walking in the park listening to nightcore music. At one point you were like a big brother.  After i had moved we still kept in touch and talked. I cant wrap my head around the fact that you are actually gone. Ill always miss you. Rest easy for me ????

> Words cant describe how slow time has moved since youve left. Ive not only lost a friend, ive lost family. I remember our long walks at Dellwood park, and our deep conversations by the train tracks, you were always there for me no matter what. The day you and I really became friends was when you hurt your ankle, and I offered to help walk you home. When I first moved away from LockPort i remember lying to my parents about going to bed and just calling you for hours. You even walked all the way to my house my last day and hung out with me for my last hour there. Even though i moved away, you were still there for me. I thought about you all day today, i didnt want to believe this was real. I love you so much, I hope youre safe now, wherever you are.
