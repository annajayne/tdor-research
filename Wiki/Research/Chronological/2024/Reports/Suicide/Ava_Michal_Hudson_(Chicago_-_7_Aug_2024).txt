> A young transgender bus driver thought her CTA job was the answer
> But Ava Hudson, 27, ended her life a year ago at a Blue Line L station in her CTA uniform.
> By  Lauren FitzPatrick   Aug 8, 2025, 11:30am BST
> A selfie of Ava Hudson as she holds up her new CTA employee ID badge. 
> 
> A caution for readers: This story contains material that discusses suicide.
> 
> The day Ava Michal Hudson got her new Chicago Transit Authority work ID in January 2024, she showed it right off.
> 
> In a selfie to her friend, she’s standing outside the Ogilvie Transportation Center near CTA’s Downtown headquarters, her dark layered hair blowing off her face, sparkly studs in her ears, chipped fuschia polish on the fingers holding the badge. She smiles faintly in the selfie but wide in the ID picture.
> 
> “CTA Employee Ava Hudson Bus Operator,” the badge reads.
> 
> Ava, a trans woman, eagerly joined the short-staffed CTA to get the stability, benefits and hiring bonus that would pay for her independence and ongoing transition after years of unemployment and scraping by with gig work.
> 
> But in her seven months driving North Side bus routes, she found an environment that was not inclusive or supportive even as the CTA specifically includes gender identity in its anti-discrimination policy, the Chicago Sun-Times found after reviewing her hundred pages of records and interviewing family and friends. Supervisors and colleagues regularly misgendered her, including on work documents. A boxy, mannish uniform put her ill at ease and confused riders into calling her “sir.” She knew no other trans co-workers. And it’s not clear she had help from her union.
> 
> She felt “uncomfortable,” her dad said, at the job she desperately needed during a vulnerable time in her life — in the life of anyone in the early stages of transitioning.
> 
> One year ago, on the morning of Aug. 7, 2024, Ava was seen in her blue CTA shirt and black pants running down the platform at the Austin L station near her home in Oak Park. Instead of boarding the Blue Line train toward her shift that day, she jumped in front of it.
> 
> Ava died by suicide. She was 27.
> 
> Police found no note. Her stunned friends and family have been left to wonder.
> 
> “We still have a lot of questions about it,” said Steve Hudson, the uncle Ava was living with during the COVID-19 lockdown, a rough time for her mentally and when she began openly transitioning.
> 
> When the CTA reviewed her death by one of its trains as part of its protocol, managers focused on the driver’s actions and on his safety record as a veteran train operator. That’s according to the seven pages transit officials released under Illinois’ public records law.
> 
> Nowhere did the agency document any efforts to question what may have led a relatively new bus operator, and a transgender one at that, to end her life on CTA property — in full uniform ahead of her scheduled shift as a bus driver.
> 
> When asked about that, CTA spokesperson Manny Gonzales referred the Sun-Times to police in Oak Park, where the Austin L station sits. Gonzales would not make anyone at the CTA available for an interview and refused to answer nearly all questions.
> 
> An uncomfortable fit
> Ava’s friends and family said the nature of her public-facing job seemed to be wearing her down, even as it provided her the financial security she had long needed. After graduating from college in 2020 in west suburban Wheaton, her hometown, she had a spate of frustrating and lean years — cosmetology school and DoorDash-type jobs where she still relied on relatives.
> 
> She wanted to live with peers, and transitioning — particularly hair removal — proved expensive. In a 2022 court case to legally change her name, Ava detailed that she spent $875 a month on “transition related costs” — more than her rent — plus hundreds more for medical expenses and counseling.
> 
> Entering CTA training in November 2023 “boosted her spirits quite a bit,” said her father, Michael Hudson. “It was great for her to have a job and to be earning some money.”
> 
> He said Ava said little about her job that paid about $61,000 a year, but she made this clear: “She wasn’t sure how to present at work. I know she was uncomfortable and not able to be herself. She had talked about looking for a different job within the CTA.”
> 
> Records of Ava’s job problems first appeared in March 2024. That’s when a supervisor not only reprimanded her for violating a sick time policy, but used “his” to describe her in this report and a later one.

> A different supervisor also referred to Hudson as “he” and “him” in May in a summary about customers on Ava’s bus who didn’t pay.
> 
> “She had problems with misgendering from both supervisors and co-workers,” said Madison McClendon, a friend who welcomed Ava in her apartment’s guest room for five months, from November 2023, when Ava applied to the CTA, through March.
> 
> Even with the most feminine uniform pieces, including a little criss-cross necktie, customers still erroneously addressed her, McClendon said. It was hardly all ill-intended, but it grated on her. And Ava felt like she couldn’t speak up.
> 
> “When it comes to the CTA uniform you’re given, it’s very androgenizing. It’s hard to be yourself,” she said.
> 
> It’s not clear how many transgender and nonbinary employees work for the CTA. Ava didn’t know any.
> 
> The work woes ramped up in July. Ava was disciplined for calling out sick two hours before a scheduled bus run. The previous week she had clipped the front of another bus while making a left turn downtown. On July 31, one week before she died, she hit the mirror of a parked car along a North Side route. Both were minor accidents, but they came with reprimands.
> 
> Around the same time, Ava suddenly cropped her hair. But she told her friend she instantly regretted it.
> 
> “She did say part of the reason for this was she felt like in her work environment, it was just too much of a struggle to require people to gender her the way she wanted,” McClendon said. At home, she wore feminine clothes, padded out her body shape and painted her nails. “You could still see her joy was in taking steps to feminize.”
> 
> It appears Ava dealt with her bosses on her own. On her disciplinary forms, nobody signed on the line reserved for Amalgamated Transit Union Local 241. Ava’s union steward wouldn’t talk without the consent of local president Keith Hill, who did not return multiple messages.
> 
> Ava never complained in writing, but two other transgender employees did. A fellow bus driver sued in 2022, alleging wrongful termination after he pushed for gender-affirming care on CTA health insurance. A federal judge dismissed his lawsuit against the agency and union; the driver has appealed. A CTA apprentice filed an internal complaint in 2023 after she was told to stop using the women’s restroom.
> 
> A path derailed
> Like many transgender people, Ava struggled with mental health issues as she was figuring out who she wanted the world to see.
> 
> Suicide risk is high among this group. Some 48% of transgender or nonbinary young people ages 13 to 24 in Illinois seriously considered suicide last year, according to a survey by the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that aims to end suicide among LGBTQ+ young people.
> 
> But Ava’s loved ones believed she was well along the path she shared a few years earlier when she asked them to use her new name.
> 
> By July 2024 she had scored a $2,600 salary bump. She booked a longed-for electrolysis session.
> 
> Later in August, she planned to move to Chicago. Through mutual friends, she found a place much closer to her bus depot in what housemate Andrea Craft touts as a “trans-centric household” with a garden and fruit trees — a place to bolster a sense of self.
> 
> The morning of her death, she was worried about being late to her shift later that day because she’d had some tardy arrivals, which can lead to discipline. She had stayed with her parents in the suburbs and wanted to drive home early, her dad said. He figured she would head straight to work.

> Ava Hudson celebrated her brother’s wedding with their family in August 2024 in a green and black party dress, the weekend before she died. She surprised her friends and family when she suddenly cut off her long wavy hair, a move they saw as trying to protect herself from being misgendered. Provided

> Transgender bus driver threw herself in front of train after being called 'sir' by passengers
> By DAILY MAIL REPORTER
> 
> A transgender bus driver took her own life by jumping in front of a train after colleagues kept referring to her as male.
> 
> Ava Michal Hudson, 27, died on August 7 last year on her way to work at the Chicago Transit Authority, while in her uniform.
> 
> She didn't leave a note and gave no indication she was suicidal before suddenly leaping to her death, just four days after attending her brother's wedding.
> 
> 'Sadly, we’ll never fully know the reason for her death, but the pain left behind after her sudden departure has been acute,' her family wrote in her obituary.
> 
> 'She has already been mourned by many, many friends and relatives across the globe. She will be very much missed and never forgotten.'
> 
> Hudson got her bus license just seven months earlier, last January, and passed probation weeks before her death, proudly announcing it in her final Facebook post.
> 
> The new job was a turning point for Hudson after several years of struggling with her gender and unemployment after graduating from Wheaton College in 2020.
> 
> Transition costs were expensive, running to $875 a month according to a 2022 court petition to legally change her name, plus more for counseling.
> 
> Her $61,000 bus driver salary finally allowed for expensive procedures and gave her financial independence for the first time.
> 
> 'The day she got her CDL driver’s permit in November 2023 was one of the happiest days of her later life and things finally started to take a turn for the better,' her obituary read.
> 
> 'She often called or texted photos to her family during breaks on her bus routes.'
> 
> But the job never quite fit - both literally, with a boxy uniform that led to passengers innocently calling her 'sir', and her isolation in the role.
> 
> Several times, first in March 2024, she was reprimanded for failing to adhere to strict sick day policies - and in both reports supervisors referred to her as a man.
> 
> Another report on non-paying customers on her route used 'he' and 'him' pronouns to refer to Hudson.
> 
> Hudson appeared to face the various infractions alone, with no record of a union representative on the paperwork, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
> 
> She never once made a written complaint, unlike at least two other transgender CTA employees.
> 
> Hudson got her bus license just seven months earlier, last January, and passed probation weeks before her death, proudly announcing it in her final Facebook post (pictured)
> 
> A bus driver sued in 2022 claiming he was wrongfully terminated after asking to undergo gender-affirming care on CTA health insurance. He lost the case but is appealing.
> 
> Then an apprentice filed an internal complaint in 2023 after she was told to stop using the women's bathroom.
> 
> Though these cases exist and CTA has gender identity in its anti-discrimination policy, Hudson's family and friends said she didn't know any other transgender workers at the company, which she found isolating.
> 
> Her family point to a traumatic brain injury cause by a fall during gymnastics in her sophomore year of high school as the start of her struggles.
> 
> David, as she was known before her transition, appeared to bounce back but 'his cognitive abilities would later become compromised as he got older'. 
> 
> She excelled in her last year of high school, finishing in the top five per cent, but began to struggle at Wheaton College.
> 
> 'During his time there, symptoms from his brain injury increasingly affected his mental abilities, leading to difficulty in his studies and bouts of depression and anxiety,' the obituary explained.
> 
> Hudson moved to Chicago in 2021, then enduring 'many difficult years and lots of questioning who he/she was and would become'.
> 
> 'Life was never easy and she was often searching for her identity and who she wanted to become,' the obituary read.
> 
> 'She was able to make some special friends though who supported her and provided a peaceful home for her to live in when she needed it most, something her parents are eternally grateful for.'
> 
> But Hudson seemed to be in a good place when she came back to Wheaton for her brother Tim's wedding, and family told her how proud they were that she had gotten her life together.
> 
> She stayed a few days then left early on the morning of August 7, worried about being late to work.
> 
> They never saw her alive again.
