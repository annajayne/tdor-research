> Another trans/nonbinary life lost to suicide. 
> 
> Emma is from Saudi Arabia. They fled to the UK to start a new life. The life story of an LGBT arab is very complicated. A human is truly lost is the cosmic of morality storms each person places on them. 
> 
> Are the Saudis outraged that she had to leave her family?
> 
> Are they outraged she had to flee her country?
> 
> Are they outraged she could not see a world where she belongs?
> 
> Are they outraged a human chose to die than continue to live among us?
> 
> No they were not. But they definitely had a lot of opinions about the sparkle I put on for a day during pride to reach people like Emma so maybe another Emma would choose to live another day and know that they too can belong. 
> 
> @alwanfoundation started an intervention scholarship named Eden. It is named after Eden Knight. She was another Saudi trans woman that took her life away. We immediately exhausted our funding in Q1 for the entire year. 
> 
> We will be fundraising this month to fund this program again. 
> 
> Please stay strong. I know it is not an easy path. Together in solidarity.
> 
> RIP Emma
