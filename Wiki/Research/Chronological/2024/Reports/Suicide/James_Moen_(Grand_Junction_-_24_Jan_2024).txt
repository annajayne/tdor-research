> MESA COUNTY, Colo. (KKTV) - The search for a missing Colorado man ended tragically after he was found dead inside a wrecked vehicle at Colorado National Monument.
> 
> Grand Junction police and other law enforcement had been searching for 23-year-old James Moen since Jan. 9, when he was seen driving into the park early that morning but never seen leaving. Police, Mesa County deputies and Colorado National Monument park rangers combed the 20,500-acre park using a combination of drones and ground searches, but for more than two weeks, the search efforts came up empty.
> 
> On the afternoon of Jan. 25, a crashed car was spotted in the area of Ute Canyon Overlook.
> 
> “[Colorado National Monument] rangers and Mesa County law enforcement responded and located a vehicle matching the description of the vehicle belonging to James Moen,” the Grand Junction Police Department said in a news release. “On Jan. 26, members of the Mesa County Search and Rescue made their way to the crash site and located a deceased person inside the vehicle matching the description of James Moen.”


> My best friend James Moen is a missing person from Grand Junction Colorado. He sent letters to his friends before disappearing to the Mesa in that area. If you see him or go around there and find his car: a black Nissan Maxima 2003 with no bumper and a busted front seat window on the drivers side, please contact the Grand Junction Police Department. He was my best friend online for 11 years and I’ve been in contact with people who were in person friends with him. 
> We miss him and want him to come home.
> He’s 23 years old, He’s 250 pounds, and he’s a transgender man. His birthday is December 29th, he loves to collect dolls and dress them up. We’ve had very little leads, and I’m hoping spreading this as much as I can will get somewhere.
