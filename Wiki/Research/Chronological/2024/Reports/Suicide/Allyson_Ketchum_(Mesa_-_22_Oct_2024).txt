> Hello, I would like to get somebody's name added to your website. Her name is Allyson Ketchum. I recently learned that she had passed away last year. She died from a self-inflicted gun wound. I'm not a family member or someone who knew them personally. I know her because she used to post YouTube videos about her transition. I'm adding links to her obituary and a YouTube video that has reposted her timeline video. In the following video, her mother confirmed her death via the comment section. 


> On October 22nd, my baby girl Alex was found lifeless in a park due to a self- inflicted gunshot. She came into this world to forge a new path and open the minds of those who rejected the LGBTQ community, as well as those within the community who turned against each other. She understood that this journey was difficult, unfair, and filled with heartbreak and suffering, yet she chose to push forward.
> 
> I envision her as a bull in a Spanish bullfight. Like the bull, she kept running and fighting even as the torero and his assistants inflicted wounds upon her. Ultimately, the final sword pierced her heart, tearing apart the three components of her being: her body, her soul, and her spirit. At that moment, everything was broken, and she took her last breath. I hope, with a sincere and heavy heart, that this event won’t be in vain. I wish that, with her passing, others will realize that when we leave this 3D dimension and earthly life, it won’t matter what our gender, race, social status, or beliefs are. Where we are headed, there are no such titles; it is a place of love and happiness. We are all connected and come from the same source. I will miss her so much, I will miss her saying or texting “I love you, Mom”. I am glad I could save some of the messages she left, I will be able to hear her physically which will give me comfort or a reason to cry when I am alone. Either way, it will help me to stay strong.
