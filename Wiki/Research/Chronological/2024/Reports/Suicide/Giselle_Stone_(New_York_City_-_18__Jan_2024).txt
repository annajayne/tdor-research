> Enquiry via https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/pages/contact from: <redacted>:
> 
> Giselle Stone died by suicide at age 20 on 18 January 2024. She was a Jewish trans woman studying fashion and design. She was from New York, USA.



> It is with great sorrow that our family shares the passing of Giselle (James) Stone, age 20. Although known for many years as James, she made it clear that her final wishes were to be known and remembered as Giselle.
> 
> Giselle was the personification of talent, beauty and grace - a gifted artist, a talented musician, a paragon of style, an advocate for anyone in need, and the most generous spirit anyone could have had the good fortune to meet.
> 
> Giselle was an artist. Her art had no boundaries: painting, poetry, textile design, music, hair, and the list goes on. And no recounting of Giselle’s life would be complete without acknowledging a huge love of avocado toast, ramen, and the cakes she made that made it impossible to fit into jeans after the holidays.
> 
> Giselle was a Sophomore at Savannah College of Art and Design, and had a bright future in sustainable fashion and textiles. Sustainability and care for our world informed all aspects of the way she lived her life, from care of animals and veganism, to care for the community, to care for friends, family and loved ones. Giselle was proudly Jewish with strong ties to the Orangeburg Jewish Center, and lived life trying to embody Jewish values.
> 
> Struggle in life is present for all of us, and we marveled at Giselle’s fortitude and strength in dealing with personal struggles - both hers and the struggles of others - always always ALWAYS being kind, loving, and more compassionate to others than to her own well being. Her immediate family of Doug, Gabriella, Brian,Tobias and Cooper are the people who were so fortunate to have the most time with Giselle. She was so fortunate to have them as parents and brothers, in addition to five cousins, two sets of aunts and uncles, and grandparents who all will be forever grateful for the time they had together.
> 
> Whether as James or Giselle, we treasure our beloved, our heart, our beautiful child. Please consider donations to The Trevor Project to honor her memory. There will be a memorial service at the Orangetown Jewish Center on Sunday, January 28, at 4:00 pm. The family will be sitting shiva privately.
