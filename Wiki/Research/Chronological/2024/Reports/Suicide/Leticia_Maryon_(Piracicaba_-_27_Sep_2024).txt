> Letícia Maryon, a 22-year- old transvestite  , took her own life after being the victim of a "detransition" process led by a pastor who claims to be an "ex-transvestite" and preaches "gay cure". The information was released by LGBTQIAPN+ movements and by federal deputy Erika Hilton (PSOL-SP) .
> 
> In recent days, Letícia had participated in a service by Pastor Flávio Amaral to talk about her process. At the event, she stated that she had been going through a "spiritual war between the flesh and the spirit" for days. 
> 
> The pastor who led Letícia, who calls himself a "former transvestite", is known for applying "conversion therapies" to LGBTQIAPN+ youth. On his social media, he preaches that it is possible to "leave homosexuality" through religion, and shares several stories, such as Letícia's. The pastor also participates in TV programs and podcasts. 
> 
> In a post on social media, congresswoman Erika Hilton (PSOL-S) lamented what happened and stated that society cannot continue to accept that religious people torture people from the LGTBQIAPN+ community to death.
> 
> "There is no other name for 'gay cure' and 'trans cure' other than TORTURE . Forcing a person to deny themselves, in degrading processes, so that they stop being who they are, is torture and cruelty. And it is also an incitement for the person to stop being themselves, in their integrity. An incitement to suicide", highlighted the deputy.
> 
> She added that "unfortunately, there are loopholes for religious leaders to continue convincing LGBTQIA+ people that their very existence is wrong, and call their torture 'cure'. 
> 
> Erika Hilton also spoke about her Bill 5034 , introduced in the Chamber of Deputies, which aims to classify "gay cure" as a method of torture. "It is a Bill that faces enormous resistance, precisely from fundamentalists who do not accept our right to be. But I will never give up on the Bill and the end of this practice," the deputy added.
> 
> Finally, the parliamentarian also issued a warning, stating that "many City Halls finance, with public money, Therapeutic Communities linked to Churches that propagate this practice. And that say they will welcome people in vulnerability or with chemical dependency, and use public money to propagate their fundamentalist ideals."

> Letícia Maryon, a 22-year-old transvestite, took her own life after a “detransition” led by a pastor who preaches gay healing and presents himself as an ex-trans.
> How long will churches continue to subject young homosexuals and transgender people to this emotional torture that they call gay healing, and then display them like trophies in their pulpits? This is cruel and inhumane!
> I dream of the day when entire churches will come forward to ask for forgiveness for the harm they caused these young people and will testify that they are ex-homophobes.
> Unfortunately, this is not the first case, and tragically, it probably will not be the last.
> Jesus never wanted to change anyone's sexuality. Do not blame him for this sick fundamentalism.
> May God comfort the hearts of Letícia Maryon's family and welcome them into His arms of love and mercy.
