> It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved daughter and sister, Madeline Esther Smith (Maddy), who left this world on July 15, 2024. Madeline, age 16, was a shining light in the lives of all who knew her, and her loss leaves an indescribable void.
> 
> Maddy was a creative, witty soul that inspired others with her musical talents and humorous thoughts. Memories of her singing and her quips will be a comfort and inspiration for the family and friends she leaves behind. She was also very generous and nurturing, displayed by the numerous recipients of her organ donations after her passing.
> 
> Family was a cornerstone of Maddy’s life. She cherished every moment spent with her loved ones and brought boundless joy to her parents and siblings. Madeline is survived by her father, Cameron Smith, mother, Emily Palmer, and stepfather Noah Palmer. She will be deeply missed by her siblings: Benjamin, Leah, Rachel, Jasper, Walter, Hannah, George, and her step siblings Asher and Eden.
> 
> A memorial service will be held to honor Madeline’s life on July 20th, at 2pm at Primrose with a viewing at 1pm. In lieu of flowers we encourage donation to either LifeShare or the OU Children’s Hospital.
