> It has been a tough time for TGIJP Black Trans Cultural Center as we have lost multiple of our dear community members/clients.
> 
> Please join us in celebrating the life of our beloved Niomi Jenkins on June 13 from 5pm - 8pm at 131 Franklin St SF, CA 94102

> Here at TGIJP we try to engage in a more communal and family way, and the passing of our comrade sisters leave us navigating grief, anger, and sadness. We will take this energy and use it to fuel the work we do to support Black trans women in California and beyond.
