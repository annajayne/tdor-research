> Statement: JMBF Calls for Adequate Investigation into the Alleged Murder of Mau Hijra in Jessore
> 
> Paris, France; January 2, 2025: France-based human rights organization, JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF), is deeply appalled and outraged by the suspicious and tragic death of Mau Hijra in Jessore, Bangladesh, which appears to be a premeditated act of murder disguised as a natural death on December 1, 2024.
> 
> JMBF believes that such abhorrent acts not only represent a blatant violation of human dignity but also highlight the rampant impunity and discrimination faced by marginalized communities, particularly the Hijra community in Bangladesh.
> 
> The organization asserts that the allegations against Mau Hijra's house owner, Fateh Begum, along with her associates—who are accused of orchestrating her death and looting her possessions—demand an immediate and uncompromising investigation.
> 
> Additionally, the Hijra community’s voice, as articulated by Bhavna Hijra, deserves urgent attention and support. No individual or community should endure such heinous acts of violence, neglect, and theft, especially in a society that claims to uphold justice and equality.
> 
> “The death of Mau Hijra and the looting of her belongings reflect a troubling pattern of systemic neglect and discrimination against the Hijra community in Bangladesh. We urge the Bangladeshi authorities to take swift and decisive action to ensure justice is served and to prevent such tragedies in the future,” said Robert Simon, Chief Adviser of JMBF and a French human rights activist.
> 
> “This incident is not an isolated one but a symptom of deeper societal injustices. We demand the immediate formation of an independent investigative body to uncover the truth and hold all those responsible accountable. The time for justice and reform is now,” added Advocate Shahanur Islam, Founder-President of JMBF and a Bangladeshi human rights lawyer.
> 
> JMBF calls upon the authorities in Bangladesh to take decisive action, including the immediate formation of an independent and impartial investigative body to uncover the truth behind Mau Hijra’s death. All individuals involved in this alleged murder and subsequent looting must be brought to justice without delay.
> 
> JMBF emphasizes that this incident reflects a broader pattern of systemic discrimination against the Hijra community in Bangladesh, underscoring the urgent need for reforms to safeguard their rights and ensure their protection under the law.
> 
> The organization demands that the Bangladeshi government reaffirm its commitment to the principles of equality and justice by taking concrete steps to protect all vulnerable communities, including decriminalizing homosexuality and enacting legal protections for the sexual minority LGBTQ community in Bangladesh as soon as possible.
> 
> JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) stands in solidarity with the Hijra community in their pursuit of justice for Mau Hijra. Together with human rights advocates around the world, we will not rest until truth and accountability are achieved in this case. Let this be a turning point in the fight against violence, discrimination, and systemic injustice in Bangladesh.

> Fact in Brief
> 
> According to news published in various newspapers in Bangladesh, the well-wishers of Mau Hijra from Jessore have alleged that her death was not natural but rather a preplanned murder. Their concerns have been further heightened by the looting of Mau Hijra's belongings, which has deepened suspicion surrounding her death. The administration has been urged to recover Mau Hijra’s looted belongings immediately. Bhavna Hijra voiced this demand on behalf of the Hijra community during a press conference held at the Press Club in Jessore on December 22, 2024.
> 
> In a written statement, Bhavna Hijra revealed that Mau Hijra had been renting a house from Fateh Begum, the wife of the late Golam, in Railgate Paschim Para, Baoisona village, Narail Kalia. On the night of December 1, 2024, Fateh Begum claimed that Mau Hijra had fallen ill and passed away.
> 
> Bhavna highlighted that various rumors had emerged regarding Mau Hijra’s death. She asserted that Mau did not die of natural causes but was, in fact, killed in a premeditated manner. The Hijra community suspects that Fateh Begum, the house owner, along with her associates—Tagar, Sagar, Khode, and Shyam—was involved in the alleged murder. It is further alleged that Fateh Begum and her accomplices—Khode, Rozina, and Shyam—looted Mau Hijra’s cash, gold jewelry, blankets, sheets, and other personal belongings.
> 
> Bhavna has called for the administration’s immediate intervention to uncover the truth behind Mau Hijra’s death and to recover her stolen possessions.
