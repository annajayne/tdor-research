> Levi Castillo, age 15, passed away in their home on Saturday, July 27th, 2024, in Springfield, Missouri. Levi was born to Tess Nelson and Michael Castillo on January 14th, 2009, in Corpus Christi, Texas. They were raised in Springfield, Missouri and graduated from Pipkin Middle School in 2024. They will be forever loved by their parents.
> 
> Levi was a beautiful person, who cared deeply about their family and friends, and who would have done anything to protect them from harm. They were an endlessly creative person who loved to draw, sculpt, write, and bake. They loved to go to the park to swing, and they were looking forward to starting high school and continuing archery and choir. They wanted to be a baker when they were older, and couldn’t wait to get their first job… just as soon as their parents would let them. They were still working on that.
> 
> Levi were fiercely proud of being part of the queer community with their mom, and their parents are so grateful to have been able to give them a loving, understanding home life with shared connections to the community. They never compromised who they were, what they believed in, or what they liked, no matter what.
> 
> Some of their favorite shows were Gravity Falls, Helluva Boss, Hazbin Hotel, The Ghost and Molly McGee, and The Amazing Digital Circus. They spent many late nights watching them with their mom, who they loved sharing interests with. They were so excited when they were finally big enough to start borrowing shoes, and took every chance to do so.
> 
> Levi also loved playing Pokémon, Undertale, Deltarune, and the Five Nights at Freddy’s series with their dad, and trips for just the two of them to 7 Brew. Levi and their dad would also experiment with new baking recipes together. Levi enjoyed having conversations with their dad while driving to and from school and laughing at dumb “dad” jokes.
> 
> On weeknights, Levi had fun watching YouTube with their parents, along with being introduced to movies from when their parents were younger. They always laughed the hardest at movies with Adam Sandler and Chris Farley in them. Their favorite movie was Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.
> 
> Levi is survived by their mother, Tess Nelson; father, Michael Castillo; aunt, Noey Klutts; uncles, Brandon and David Castillo; grandmother, Lisa Castillo; and great-grandmother, Lynnette McCallie. They are also survived by their beloved cats, Sally and Eddy, who miss them very much, and the family dogs, Barbie and Dave, who misses his couch naptime friend.
> 
> A private viewing will be held on Sunday, August 4th, 2024, at 2:00pm, at Greenlawn Funeral Home North in Springfield. A Celebration of Life Fireworks Memorial will be held at a later date that is yet to be determined, at the Greenlawn Memorial Gardens located in Springfield, Missouri.
> 
> In lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations be made in Levi’s memory to The Assistance Fund for their Epilepsy Copay Assistance Program, which helps people with epilepsy pay for their medications and treatments. Please click on the link below to make a donation in Levi’s memory:

> Arrangements are under the compassionate direction of Greenlawn Funeral Home North in Springfield, Missouri.
