> The State Attorney General's Office is investigating the death of a transsexual person found under the vehicular bridge located at the intersection of Aguascalientes Norte Avenue and Zacatecas Blvd., near the Agricultural Shopping Center.
>
> The discovery occurred at approximately 2:03 a.m. on Tuesday, when Aguascalientes highway police, who were carrying out a surveillance tour along Aguascalientes Norte Avenue, upon reaching the intersection with Blvd. to Zacatecas, near the Mega store, observed a person lying face up on the central median and next to one of the concrete pillars.
> 
> The situation seemed strange to them and they decided to investigate, identifying the victim as a transsexual person, between 40 and 45 years old, 1.65 tall, with a thin complexion, dark complexion, and long, curly black hair. She was wearing a pink blouse, a skirt with black shorts, black fishnet pantyhose, black tennis shoes and a pink scarf.

> To carry out the pertinent investigations, agents from the Homicide Group of the PDI, personnel from the Expert Investigation Directorate and the agent from the Public Ministry of Hospitals of the FGE appeared at the scene.
