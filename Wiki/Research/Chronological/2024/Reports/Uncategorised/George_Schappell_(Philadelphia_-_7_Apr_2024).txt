> 
> They'd lived independently since they were 24, traveling the world together as George pursued a career as a country singer and performed across the U.S. and in countries like Germany and Japan. Lori was an award-winning bowler, who spent time working at the hospital around George's performing gigs.
> 
> Per GWR, George had Spina Bifida and couldn't walk. So, he moved around using a wheelchair that Lori pushed for him.

> The world records site reported that the twins lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Pa. and each had their own rooms — they alternated their sleeping arrangements every night and even showered separately.
> 
> In 2007, George, born Dori, announced that he was a transgender male, making him and Lori the "first same-sex conjoined twins to identify as different genders," according to GWR.
> 
> Despite doing their best to maintain their own lives, GWR reported that they "always" said they didn't want to be separated.
