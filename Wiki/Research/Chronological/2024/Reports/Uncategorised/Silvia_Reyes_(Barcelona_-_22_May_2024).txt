> The historic trans activist Silvia Reyes, born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria although living in Barcelona for more than half a century, one of the first voices to fight for LGTBI rights in Spain and a participant in the first pride demonstration in 1977, has died this Wednesday in the Catalan capital at the age of 75 .
> 
> ThePride! of Barcelona has confirmed her death through a message on her social network account «At Pride Barcelona we regret to announce the death of Silvia Reyes, a tireless trans activist based in Barcelona. "We will always keep her in our memory of her and we take advantage of this means to convey our condolences to her family and friends," said the organizers of the Barcelona pride.
> 
> Reyes was precisely one of the first participants in the first founding pride, as the demonstration for LGTBI rights that crossed La Rambla on June 26, 1977 is considered . It was her condition of "transsexuality", a crime under Franco's law of dangerousness and social rehabilitation, which led her to go to prison in the early 70s and along with 37 other women in the same situation.
> 
> Until the death of the dictator Franco, Reyes was not able to live freely in Spain and that is why he also spent a period of his life in Paris and Switzerland, where he dedicated himself to entertainment. A close friend of the trans woman murdered in the Ciutadella park in 1991, Mónica Rescalvo, she fought for reparation for those who, like her, suffered repression due to their gender identity in her final years and never stopped attending the LGTBI demonstrations until the end . .
> 
> In addition, six years ago Reyes participated in the documentary "Crits de llibertat" and in the book "The Double Transition" by Extremaduran journalist Raúl Solís. This Wednesday, numerous associations have conveyed their condolences and words of remembrance for Reyes, such as the trans family entity Chrysallis, from where they have highlighted his personality.
> 
> «I have defended that it was always 'worth it' to pay such a high price (prison, exile, etc.) to fight for his freedom. "His undeniable contribution to the LGTBI reality of our time and his tireless action over the years means that today, the day of his death, hundreds of people (from politicians to activists and anonymous people) mourn his loss on social networks," they pointed out from that association.
