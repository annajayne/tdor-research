> 
> The tragic discovery of Amanda Warburton, aged 52, "mummified" in her flat was revealed after the Cheshire woman had not been seen or heard from for seven months.
> 
> Police located Ms Warburton deceased in her Runcorn apartment, with the circumstances surrounding her death being deemed as "non suspicious" during her inquest held this month.
> 
> A severe level of decomposition was found when Ms Warburton's body was discovered on September 17, involving significant police investigation after relatives raised concerns upon noticing her window remained shut over a fortnight period.
> 
> Found lifeless in her residence by officers at precisely 5.47pm, as reported by the Liverpool Echo, a subsequent inquest on October 16 at Cheshire Coroner's Court characterised Ms Warburton as somewhat of a "loner".
> 
> Confronted with the heavily decomposed state of her remains, Senior Coroner Jacqueline Devonish recorded the cause of death as 'unascertained due to severe decomposition and mummification', leading to an open conclusion due to uncertainty about the events causing her demise, reports the Mirror.
> 
> Without a conclusive cause of death, and given the enigmatic nature of the case, the coroner expressed the impossibility of her findings. In response to the distressing event, Ms Warburton's sister initiated a GoFundMe campaign for travel funds from Queensland, Australia back to the UK.
> 
> Sharing the sorrowful news on social media, her sister divulged: "It is with a very heavy heart that we announce the passing of our beautiful sister Amanda (Mandy). We are broken. We love you enormously and we will miss you so much."
> 
> Police reported that the residence on Norton Hill was "sparsely furnished" with very little food present and an accumulation of mail behind the door. Inside, two newspapers dated February 18 were located on the coffee table and a bottle of milk with a February 19 expiration date was in the fridge.
> 
> A sticker was also noticed on the front door, which urged her to get in touch with the housing association.
