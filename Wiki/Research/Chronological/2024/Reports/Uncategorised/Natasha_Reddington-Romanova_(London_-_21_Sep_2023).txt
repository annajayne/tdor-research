> When she again failed to come in on Tuesday morning, her workplace began calling her next of kin. The police were contacted, and a missing persons investigation was launched.

> 
> Ms Kawalik described Natasha as “incredibly glamorous, and very, very funny”.
> 
> “She’s a bit of an icon of Soho,” she told the Standard on Friday. She’s been around Soho for some time.
> 
> “She was formerly a dancer at Madame Jojo’s. She also famously worked behind the bar at Trisha’s for years. She’s Trisha’s best friend.
