> CABA: A 29-year-old trans woman died on the street while waiting for her turn at a bus stop
> Carolina Machado was 29 years old, had migrated from Ecuador and was homeless. She worked as a sex worker in the Constitución neighborhood. There are reports of more homeless people, fewer public policies and an increase in police persecution.

> Buenos Aires, Argentina . On Monday afternoon, Carolina Machado Abad, a trans woman who had migrated from Ecuador, died homeless during the cold snap in Buenos Aires. She was to have turned 30 on August 30. 
> 
> “I had a transfer to a shelter in my pocket,” Georgina Orellano, director of Casa Roja and general secretary of the Association of Prostitutes of Argentina (AMMAR), told Presentes. Carolina was a sex worker and had gone to Casa Roja , in the Constitución neighborhood, where they helped her start the immigration process. She had obtained temporary residency and was waiting for her national identity document. 
> 
> Over the past month, Carolina spent several nights at the Uspallata hostel, run by the Buenos Aires City Government. Police found her body in the plaza in front of the Muñiz Hospital, in Parque Patricios. 
> 
> “She was hospitalized for a long time at the Ramos Mejía hospital. When she left, she found herself in absolute precariousness, unable to receive assistance from the State policies, which are very limited. One of the requirements to receive any subsidy is to have regularized immigration status,” Orellano explained. 
> 
> The last time her companions saw her was on Friday, July 5. She went to Casa Roja asking to be admitted to a home. “ We called several centers and they were all full. The social workers at the different centers told us that they had no vacancies. There was no room, there was a waiting list. “They gave her an appointment to appear on July 16, ” said Orellano, who is organizing Carolina's farewell at Casa Roja. They have already contacted her family and hope to repatriate her body.

> Carolina's death coincided with statements by the Secretary of Security of the City of Buenos Aires, Diego Kravetz, who on Radio Futurock made the controversial statement: "If as a neighbor you give a plate of hot soup to a person who lives on the street, you are making them poor." Kravetz's comments come as in the last two weeks there have been at least 7 deaths of homeless people in the City of Buenos Aires. 
> 
> The organizations believe that these deaths are linked to the emptying of housing policies and the hardening of discrimination and violence by the City Government towards people living on the streets. According to figures from April, there are 3,560 homeless people in the capital of the country. This represents an increase of 14% compared to last year. However, civil society organizations report 8,028 homeless people, according to this note from the media Chequeado. 
> 
> No tan Distintes (NTD), an organization that works with women and LGBTI+ people in situations of social vulnerability, denounces that the problem has worsened since Jorge Macri assumed the position of Head of Government.
> 
>  “Jorge Macri said that homeless people are dangerous and that the whole approach had to be changed. They created a mental health protocol that allows people to be taken to psychiatric wards involuntarily. The Borda Hospital has been denouncing this. The government said that they are opening new shelters, but for months every time you call the 108 line there is no vacancy,” Paula Migilone from NTD told Presentes. She added: “They have an under-measure of the number of homeless people. Everything got worse with the elimination of specific public policies for women and dissidents. They are making a policy of displacement, they don’t want them to be seen. And that has short legs, because people are dying and now these policies are reaching the media.”

> “More and more comrades are sleeping in the square”
> Orellano also confirms the issue of displacement, denouncing in particular the situation in the Constitución neighbourhood, an area where several sex workers, trans people and migrants live and work, and where the prices for access to a roof have skyrocketed. 
> 
> “Rent of a room per day costs between 19,000 and 22,000 pesos. Per month, between 170,000 and 250,000 pesos. The conditions offered by hotels, tenements and boarding houses are overcrowded, unhealthy and precarious. So, we see more and more companions who, like Carolina, sleep in the plaza. When they don’t have money to pay for their room per day, they are in the shacks, wandering around Constitución, also experiencing a lot of violence from the police. So, more and more of them are displaced. There are companions sleeping on the side of the highway,” says Orellano.

> Police violence increased
> Not so different also focuses on the increase in police violence. “They take their belongings with violence, they evict them from the public road.” 
> 
> Every year, on August 19, the Day of the Struggle for Homelessness, the Assembly for Homeless People and the Faculty of Psychology's program “Sociability on the Margins” publish a report recording and analyzing these acts of violence, which - they add - go unnoticed and are intersectional. “For example, for LGBTI+ people there is an underreporting. Many use strategies to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity to avoid further violence, which is multiplied in dissident groups.”

> A homeless trans woman died
> She was Ecuadorian, she was in front of the Muñiz Hospital and she had an appointment to start the process to request the housing subsidy. At the same time, Kravetz said that "the mind" of homeless people is "different from the rest of citizens."
> 
> Five homeless people have died in the last two weeks. The deaths occurred in the City of Buenos Aires, the richest district in the country, and in the midst of a violent cold wave that has not been seen for more than 10 years. According to AMMAR General Secretary Georgina Orellano, this latest death is different from the previous ones, it concerns a trans and migrant woman who, faced with state apathy, was trying to apply for a housing subsidy. 
> 
> A fondo. “The report that the police gave us says that she died on July 15 and that they found her at noon in the plaza in front of the Muníz Hospital,” said Orellano in conversation with El Grito del Sur. The plaza she refers to is in front of the “Francisco Javier Muñiz” Infectious Diseases Hospital, in the Parque Patricios neighborhood, just 10 blocks from where the Buenos Aires City Government headquarters is located.
> 
> According to Georgina, Clarita was a sex worker and this situation was what made it easier for her to approach AMMAR. “She was in very poor health, she was already homeless and had been hospitalized in the Ramos Mejía hospital,” she added, explaining that, because she did not have documents, it was very difficult for her to make arrangements to obtain legal assistance.
> 
> This is not the first case. Two of the other four deceased, one in Once and another at the entrance to Villa 31, in Retiro, were found dead and without documents.
> 
> According to information obtained by Grito del Sur, at the time of finding Clarita's body, a series of shifts were also found that would allow her to carry out the housing procedure. Her family, who still live in Ecuador, have already been informed about the situation and have begun to resolve the necessary procedures for the wake. Orellano and his organization made their premises in Constitución available to say goodbye.
> 
> "We have several colleagues in the same situation. Before they lived in hotels but today the cheapest room is 170 thousand a month," concluded the union representative.
> 
> Since the arrival of Jorge Macri, the Government of the City of Buenos Aires has intensified its operations for homeless people. These operations were strongly criticized by organizations and neighbors who reported that people's things were stolen and no housing solutions were provided. The result: five deaths.
> 
> The director of the Project 7 Civil Association, Horacio Ávila, who works on this issue, had warned that Jorge Macri “has a kind of cruelty towards people who live on the streets.”
> 
> “We believe that they are creating an imaginary enemy, socially speaking: the dirty one, the one who gives a bad image, the one who bothers, the one who annoys, the criminal, as Kravetz said, that 50% of homeless people are criminals. “Creating this imaginary enemy is what enables them to carry out all kinds of repressive, discriminatory and violent actions,” he said.
> 
> Ávila's warning was confirmed by statements made today by the city's security secretary, Diego Kravetz . The city official confirmed that "there are many homeless people in the city." More than 4,500 homeless people, to be precise.
> 
> "In the City, there is a coexistence issue that we are trying to put a new spin on; the situation of homelessness is a very sad situation and romanticizing it is creating poverty," he said.
> 
> “There are different types of homeless people, the ones that are complicated are those who run slums because they tend to do illegal things,” he added and clarified that “there are a lot of homeless people with psychiatric problems and addictions, they need to be approached differently.”
> 
> Kravetz insisted on the City Government's line of arguments and reiterated that "coexistence is difficult," especially because "it is shocking for a person to have someone living in the lobby of their building."
> 
> But the most controversial phrase came later. “They protest about the situation in the shelters because they have rules. The shelter makes you uncomfortable because it structures your life differently from what you are used to in solitude. The mind of the cartonero is already different from the rest of the citizens because of his type of work, like that of the people who live on the streets. If as a neighbor you give a plate of hot soup to the person who lives on the street, you accommodate him in poverty and it is a non-virtuous cycle ,” he declared.
