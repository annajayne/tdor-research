Transgender Individual committed Suicide in Nabinagar, Brahmanbaria Due to Mental Stress

On March 25, 2024, Saidul Islam Nayan (26) committed suicide by hanging himself in Darra village of Nabinagar upazila, Brahmanbaria. Nayan was the eldest of three sons of Md. Shariful Islam and Nargis Akhtar from Darra village in the Rasullabad union. It is known that he had been in Saudi Arabia for a long time.

According to family sources, although Nayan was biologically male, his behavior was akin to that of the third gender. Hijras are often ridiculed by locals for their affinity and feminine nature. Locals believe that he may have committed suicide due to social bullying and the inferiority complex associated with being a hijra. The Acting Police Inspector (OC) of Nabinagar Police Station stated that more details will be provided after the investigation.

Other members of her family were bornn in Oakland California but niomi doesn't specify. I also saw some references to Naomi versus Niomi but wonder if that's just typos. She was a 49ers fan, she worked several retail jobs, Her birthday was June 13 and she seems to have been 43 years old. Her mother died in 2017. She filed a lot of small claims lawsuits. She seemed to have traveled around California a lot.
