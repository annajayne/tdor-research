suicide


> A TRANSGENDER prisoner died after prison staff "underestimated" the risk she posed, a report has found.
> 
> Davina Canning, previously known as Arthur David Canning, from Evesham, was found dead in her cell on July 29, 2023, at HMP Hewell. She had hanged herself.
> 
> A report by The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) into her death said: "While prison staff appropriately started suicide and self-harm prevention procedures (ACCT) when Ms Canning arrived at Hewell, there was insufficient strategic consideration given to managing her risks effectively. Her level of risk was underestimated, and observations set too infrequently as a result. More could have been done to identify and review support actions, that might have helped to address Ms Canningâ€™s ongoing issues."
> 
> Ms Canning had been remanded to HMP Hewell - a male prison - two weeks earlier to await sentence having admitted assaulting a police officer.
> 
> She had told staff in court that she would take her life if she was sent to prison, but the report highlighted that her level of risk was 'underestimated' when she arrived at prison and she was not prioritised for a mental health assessment. 
> 
> The report stated the 59-year-old was a 'very challenging' prisoner to manage and throughout her two weeks at HMP Hewell, having engaged in 'persistent' anti-social and self-harming behaviour. This behaviour had also made her unpopular with fellow inmates.
> 
> "The staff on her houseblock managed Ms Canning with patience and professionalism, but there should have been more input from the night manager with proper consideration given to the risk she posed," said the report.
> 
> Ms Canning had served previous custodial sentences, whilst identifying as a male, during which she had self harmed. Following her release in June 2022, Ms Canning began to identify as female, but did not have a gender recognition certificate.
> 
> At Hewell she was granted vulnerable prisoner status and housed in a single cell.
> 
> The report - published in April - said on the night leading up to her death, Ms Canning continuously pressed her emergency cell bell and engaged in other antisocial behaviour including exposing herself to prison staff.
> 
> Most calls were answered within one and two minutes, with the longest being around five minutes, and met with swearing.
> 
> The report praised the staff on duty that night, saying they acted with 'compassion and professionalism' towards Ms Canning 'in difficult circumstances'.
> 
> "They were subject to verbal abuse from her for much of the night, and other provocative behaviour, some of which was sexually explicit," said the report. "They continued to respond quickly to her many cell bells. When Ms Canning became quiet, they might easily have assumed that she had now settled for the night. Instead, they checked her and identified the emergency earlier than might otherwise have been the case."
> 
> The report made a number of recommendations:
> 
* > The Governor should review the quality and compliance with policy of ACCT management in the previous 12 months, identify any improvements required, and devise a plan to deliver those improvements. 
> 
* > The Head of Healthcare should ensure that prisoners who present with persistent and challenging behaviours are assessed according to their level of risk and need, with consideration given to their most suitable location.  
> 
* > The Head of Healthcare should ensure that all emergency response staff attend medical emergency codes immediately.
> 
> Following publication of the report, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said their thoughts remain with Ms Canning's friends and family, and since her death, the PPO recommendations had been implemented.
