> Amber McLaughlin (January 13, 1973 â€“ January 3, 2023) was an American transgender woman executed in Missouri for the 2003 rape and murder of her ex-girlfriend, [Beverly Guenther](https://abtc.ng/beverly-guenther-murder-how-did-beverly-guenther-die/). At the time of the crime, McLaughlin was living as male, transitioning from male to female while incarcerated.  She thus became the first openly transgender person to be executed in the United States.  McLaughlin's legal name remained her birth name, Scott A. McLaughlin, and she was so identified in the death warrant and prison records.
> 
> McLaughlin was a registered sex offender, due to a 1992 conviction for sexual assault against a 14 year old girl.
> 
> At McLaughlin's 2006 trial, the jury deadlocked on the issue of the death penalty.[6] In most U.S. states, that would result in a sentence of life imprisonment. However, Missouri is one of only two states (the other being Indiana), in which a judge has the discretion to sentence a defendant to death if the jury deadlocks on the issue of capital punishment.
> 
> In August 2021, McLaughlin's sentence was reinstated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
