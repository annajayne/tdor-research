> A gender nonconforming person named Dominic Dupree (also known as Dominic Palace) was shot to death on Friday, October 13 in Chicago. Dominic was 25. Note that because we are not clear on pronouns, we will use they/them in this post. Dominic used both she and he on publicly visible social media.
> 
> From Fox 32 in Chicago
> 
> The 25-year-old, who remains unidentified, was inside a vehicle in an alley around 10:46 p.m. when gunfire broke out in the 7800 block of South Jeffery Boulevard, according to police. [They were] struck multiple times throughout the body and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.
> 
> Dominic’s family has set up a crowdfund for funeral expenses. Please note this linked site uses their name assigned at birth and male pronouns.
> 
> Dominic was born in Indianapolis and relocated to Gary, Indiana. In 2016, they graduated from Went to Thea Bowman Leadership Academy. Dominic also studied at  21st Century Charter School of Gary.  They established and operated Private Protection Division LLC in Gary as well as Hondo IV Lawncare & Snow Removal LLC.
> 
> Dominic’s social media is filled with Chicago sports teams and athletes, political figures, Tyler Perry movies, and their favorite tv shows.
> 
> Thus, we sadly acknowledge Dominic as the 32nd trans or gender nonconforming person whose violent death has been reported in 2023. They are the 24th trans person of color and the 17th Black person.  Dominic is the third gender nonconforming person this year. A trans person has been killed in the US every 8.9 days in 2023. “Reported” is an important distinction to make as we know there are more folx whose deaths remain unacknowledged. In fact, we have included two unidentified people whose remains were discovered this year.
> 
> Rest in power, Dominic. Your industrious nature, your willingness to embrace your truth, and your love for so many pieces of your life are examples of how you will be remembered. You deserved all of the years to grow into your adult life. I am very sorry that we failed to create a safe world for you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
