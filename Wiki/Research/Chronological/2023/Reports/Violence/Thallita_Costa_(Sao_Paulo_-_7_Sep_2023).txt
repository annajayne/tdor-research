> Young trans Thallita Costa, aged 21, was found dead this Thursday (7) in the Campo Limpo neighborhood, in the South Zone of São Paulo.
> 
> The body was found by police a few meters from where she lived, hours after the young woman left home.
> 
> The military police registered a police report at the 37th DP in Campo Limpo after having passed through two other police districts. According to the police report, Thallita had injuries to her face, neck and shoulders, in addition to several burns on her body.
> 
> The case was registered as a homicide. The incident report says that the police officers, upon arriving at the scene, saw the body lying on a public street with blood marks on the mouth and nose. There was no identification, only knowing that she was a transsexual woman.
> 
> Relatives of the victim, however, question how the agents found Thallita's house, since she was without documents.
> 
> "Very strange that one of the police officers and another said that they weren't supposed to say that they had gone to the house to warn us. Especially because Thallita left without a document and we don't know how they found Thallita's mother. And they said that we didn't needed to register BO", says a close person who prefers not to be identified.
> 
> A survey carried out by the National Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals (Antra) reveals that the state of São Paulo leads the ranking of murders of trans people in the country. Between 2017 and 2022 there were 116 deaths.
> 
> "This happens every day to several women, simply because they are who they are", says Lari Figueiredo, Thallita's friend.
