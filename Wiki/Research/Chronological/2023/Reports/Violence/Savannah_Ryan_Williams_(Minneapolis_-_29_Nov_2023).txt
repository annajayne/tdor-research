> A Minnesota man accused of shooting and killing a trans woman in the head last week only moments after she completed a sex act on him made his first appearance in court Wednesday.
> 
> Damarean Kaylon Bible, 25, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the death of Savannah Ryan Williams, 38. Her lifeless body was found in a Minneapolis courtyard around 9 a.m. on November 29 with a single gunshot wound to the head, according to court documents. Witnesses told police they heard a gunshot in the courtyard earlier that morning at 5:45 a.m. and saw a man working away from the scene.
> 
> Investigators used surveillance footage to observe a man and a woman entering the courtyard in the 3000 block of 4th Avenue S around 5 a.m. yesterday. Around 5:45 a.m. a man was observed exiting the courtyard alone and walking to the Lake Street light rail station. The man later exited at the Nicollet/5th Street station and was tracked to a nearby apartment building. Using a photo from the surveillance footage, Bible was identified to police by building management and taken into custody. Police say a subsequent search of his apartment turned up multiple firearms, including a handgun with no serial number and a rifle.

> 
> The Hennepin County Attorney's Office on Tuesday charged Damarean Kaylon Bible, 25, with second-degree murder in connection to the shooting of Savannah Ryan Williams, 38, of St. Paul. (The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office identified Williams, who was transgender, as Miguel R. Stillday.)
> 
> Bible was arrested and booked into jail Friday. An attorney is not yet listed for Bible, who remains jailed; his first court appearance Wednesday.
> 
> According to the charges based on surveillance video:
> 
> Williams was left for dead and it was hours before her body was discovered Nov. 29.
> 
> Officers responded around 9 a.m. to a report of a person not breathing in a courtyard at 3023 4th Av. S.
> 
> Surveillance video from nearby buildings shows Williams and Bible walking toward the crime scene at 5 a.m. Bible left alone around 5:45 a.m., when witnesses reported hearing a gunshot from the area. Witnesses also say they saw a man at the time walking north from the crime scene along 4th Avenue toward Lake Street.
> 
> Video then showed Bible head to the Lake Street light-rail station where he rode a train downtown and exited at the Nicollet/5th Street Station. He walked south to an apartment building at 95 S. 10th St. Investigators went there and showed a photograph of Bible to building management, who identified the suspect. Bible was arrested as he left the apartment.
> 
> Bible initially denied being involved, but when shown video evidence he admitted to shooting Williams. Bible told investigators that he walked past Williams, who was sitting at a bus shelter on Lake Street. He said that Williams asked if he wanted sex and they went to the nearby courtyard. Bible said he had a 9mm handgun in his pocket and he began to feel "suspicious" of Williams. After the sexual act, he shot her.
> 
> He called his parents from jail and in one conversation with his dad, Bible admitted to killing someone. Bible in the call said that while he felt sorry and wasn't God, he "had to do it."
> 
> A search warrant for his apartment turned up a 9mm Polymer80 handgun with no serial number and a .22 caliber rifle. Investigators also recovered shoes and clothing he wore during the murder as seen on surveillance video.
> 
> Bible was also charged Tuesday with first-degree aggravated robbery in connection with an attack Nov. 5 on Nicollet Mall. In that case, a victim flagged down police and said Bible pulled a black semiautomatic handgun on him when asked to empty his pockets.

> 
> MINNEAPOLIS — Savannah Ryan Williams' friends say she grew during Tea Time, a support group for transgender women, at The Aliveness Project. 
> There, she would join others to talk about issues, fears and joy. 
> 
> On Wednesday, the group gathered for another reason. They talked about Savannah Ryan Williams' alleged murder and hate toward their community. 
> 
> "She was full of life," said Luna Hernandez, who met her at the group. "It's very unfortunate that her life got taken away." 
> Court documents say 25-year-old Damarean Kaylon Bible admitted to shooting Williams in the head. He told police she approached him for a sexual encounter but he began to feel "suspicious." After the act, he shot and killed her, according to paperwork. Bible confessed after police found surveillance video of him at the scene near the Lake Street light rail station.
> Paperwork says while in jail, Bible told his dad he “just murdered someone.” It reads that he felt sorry for killing the victim and knew he wasn’t God, but he “had to do it.” 
> 
> "It's a hate crime," said Amber Muhm, who finds a feeling of safety at Tea Time. 
> 
> "We have a right to life," said State Representative Leigh Finke. "Savannah had a right to live; she should be alive. There is no other detail that matters. Being murdered and being murdered in the way that this happened is gruesome." 
> Finke used to go to Tea Time. She shares feelings of anxiety with the women here. 
> 
> "It just needs to stop," said Muhm. "We have to be able to walk in public and just be constantly looking over our shoulder and constantly worried about what's going to happen." 
> 
> "We are people at the end of the day and we are humans just like everybody else," said Celeste Grignon-Juarez, who got to know Williams over the past few months. "Losing her so tragically after her making so many great improvements in life was really sad. Nobody deserves to die this way. But it's not an uncommon way for trans women to die this way."
> 
> "The loss of yet another member of our trans community is a source of deep pain for all of us," read a statement from The Aliveness Project. "Acts of discrimination, bigotry, and hatred have no place in our community."
> Bible's bail is set at $1 million. The Aliveness Project says folks in the community can go to Tea Time if they have feelings of uncertainty. 



> Savannah was a member of the local support group Tea Time, where she and others would speak about the joy and the challenges that came with being a trans woman.
> 
> Amber Muhm, another member of Tea Time, told KARE 11 that what happened to Williams was a “hate crime.”
> 
> “It just needs to stop,” she continued. “We have to be able to walk in public and just be constantly looking over our shoulder and constantly worried about what’s going to happen.”
> Tea Time remembers Williams as a woman who was “fierce, full of life, with a big personality and an even bigger heart.”
