shot


> As has been noted, a 26 year old white trans man, Jean Thomas Butchart was fatally shot in a Belleville, Michigan mobile home park on August 4, 2023.
> 
> According to the Macomb Daily:
> 
> Matthew Torrey Tiggs,22, is charged in a crime spree that began in the Van Buren Estates mobile home park. He is accused in the fatal shooting of a 26-year-old person; the non-fatal shooting of a 47-year-old man; and the assault of a 45-year-old man, all of Van Buren Township.
> 
> The victim’s name was clarified by the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office Thursday. After first using a name given to the person at birth, officials in a release issued Thursday afternoon stated the dead man’s name was Jean Butchart. This came after numerous loved ones representing the family contacted The Macomb Daily to say he was a transgender male who identified as Jean and was in the process of legally changing his name when he died. An obituary published on the Nie Family Funeral Home of Ann Arbor’s website Wednesday said he was part of a family with two sisters and was working toward a career in education.
> 
> Jean had two sisters and had completed an Environmental Studies BS and was working professionally in managing water.  His obituary reads that “His love of the natural world extended to a love of camping, foraging, gardening, and mushroom-hunting, earning him the affectionate nickname “Nature Boy” among his many friends.” Recently, Jean was planning to return to school to earn a degree in science education.
> 
> In any case, Jean’s death just recently came to attention of those who track the lists. It was heartening to read that his friends and family advocated so strongly for him in the media reporting. One imagines he was surrounded by loving and accepting support system while he lived as well. Jean’s mother, Amy Butchart, described him as “a well-loved person and unofficial leader in the local trans community.” Note that the media reports use Jean Thomas’ name assigned at birth and misgender him.
> 
> Jean Thomas’ was shot at point blanker range in his head. The murderer fired the weapon multiple times. And then committed other murders.
> 
> At this time, Jean Thomas is the sixth trans masculine victim in 2023. He is the 39 victim of fatal violence reported in the US. All six trans men victims were under 30. Nearly 75% of the total victims were under the age of 30. Based on the available information, we are losing a trans person every 8.5 days in the United States this year. I’m sure that’s vastly under reported. Even Jean Thomas’ death while well documented and with a supportive family, even then we still didn’t know until this week.
> 
> Earlier this week, we honored the neighbors lost to violence as part of the Trans Day of Remembrance. I’m sad, so very sad, to craft yet another memorial just a few days later. Without a doubt, I’m sure that there will be others. In 2022, I wrote 40 memorials. As of today, I’ve written 39 this year as of November 22, 2023.
> 
> It adds an especial somber note to the holiday.
> 
> Rest in power, Jean Thomas. Undoubtedly your legacy weaves its way through your community, in the air and the water and the stories. Thank you for helping to create a healthier and safer environment for us. I am so sorry we did not create a safer world for you to thrive and grow older.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
