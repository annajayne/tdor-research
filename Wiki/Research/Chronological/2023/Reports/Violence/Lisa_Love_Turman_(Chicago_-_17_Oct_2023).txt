> CHICAGO — A South Side family is seeking justice following the shooting death of their loved one.
> 
> Family members told WGN News they believe the shooting was targeted due to Jamol Lisa Turman identifying as transgender.
> 
> “An all-around good person who did not deserve this,” said Donna, a cousin of Turman, during a phone interview with WGN News. “A loving, caring, free-spirited person. Always smiling and laughing.”
> 
> According to police, around 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, the 35-year-old was shot in the chest and back near 79th St. and Cottage Grove Ave. Loved ones said Turman was walking home after leaving a friend’s house.
> 
> “A car just drove up, made a U-turn and (saw) my cousin,” Donna said. “Approximately 30 seconds later, the car stopped and my cousin was shot.”
> 
> According to family members, several neighbors knew that Turman identified as transgender. Now, they intend to get justice.
> 
> “Why would this happen?” Turman’s cousin asked. “Why would someone think they could take someone else’s life?”
