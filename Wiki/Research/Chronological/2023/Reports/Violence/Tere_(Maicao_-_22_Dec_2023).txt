> December 23, 2023. On the night of Friday, December 22, on the eve of the Christmas holidays, an unfortunate incident of violence was reported in Maicao (La Guajira). Tere, a 48-year-old trans woman of Venezuelan nationality, who worked as a stylist in the municipality, was murdered on Carrera 41b # 29a-71, Los Laureles neighborhood.
> 
> This act of violence colors the Christmas celebration among LGBTIQ+ people in the municipality and raises alarm about the potential increase in violence, characteristic of the last days of the year. With the murder of Tere, the Caribbean Affirmative Human Rights Observatory reports 65 victims of homicides and/or feminicide in Colombia. Likewise, we call for alert regarding the rights situation of Venezuelan migrants with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities in the department of La Guajira, due to the risk of double impact due to the Colombian armed conflict.
> 
> We ask the authorities to carry out an exhaustive investigation into the facts, taking into account the guidelines of Directive 006 of 2023, launched in November 2023 by the Attorney General of the Nation. For their part, local authorities must generate dialogue strategies with civil society to discuss the context that LGBTIQ+ people may face in the municipality.
> 
> We sympathize with Tere's family and friends for these events, hoping that there will soon be justice for her and her crime will not go unpunished.
