> Telangana Woman Contracted Murder of Transgender Husband
> Telangana Woman Apprehended in Contract Killing of Transgender Husband
> In an unsettling narrative emerging from the Siddipet district in Telangana, a woman named Vedasri has been apprehended on charges of orchestrating the murder of her husband, Roja, formerly Daripally Venkatesh. The victim was a transgender individual who had undergone a sex change surgery. The dramatic turn of events unfolded on December 11 when the contracted killers, now in police custody, smothered Roja to death after sharing drinks with him. Vedasri had allegedly contracted the murder for a hefty sum of Rs 18 lakh, of which Rs 4.60 lakh had been paid upfront.
> 
> Unravelling a Complicated Relationship
> Vedasri and Roja, whose union was sealed in 2014, shared the bond of parenthood with their eight-year-old daughter. However, beneath the seemingly normal family facade, lurked a tumultuous marital relationship riddled with issues of dowry harassment. Matters spiralled out of control when Venkatesh underwent a sex change operation and adopted the identity of Roja. The subsequent shift in dynamics saw Roja resorting to begging for livelihood and allegedly harassing Vedasri to involve their daughter in the act. This not only caused severe domestic disturbances but also reached Vedasri’s professional sphere, leading to the loss of her job.
> 
> A Suspicious Death Morphs into a Murder Investigation
> This disconcerting chain of events took a sinister turn when Roja was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Initially, the case was approached as a death under dubious conditions. However, the autopsy report indicated a more sinister possibility—murder. The subsequent investigation led to Vedasri’s confession of her role in the crime. Alongside her, an accomplice named Boini Ramesh and one of the killers, Ippa Shekhar, were arrested. The police are currently on the lookout for three other accomplices involved in this chilling crime.
> 
> A Community Under Spotlight
> This horrific incident has thrown a spotlight on the marginalized transgender community in India, highlighting the struggles they face in their personal and public lives. It raises pressing questions on the societal acceptance of transgender individuals, the pressures they face, and the dire consequences these pressures can lead to.

The couple had got married in 2014 and had a child in 2015, a police official said. In 2019, the husband underwent gender reassignment surgery to become a woman. Since then, they had been staying apart, the official said.
> 
> The transgender person, subsequently started "harassing" the woman, who worked as an accountant in a private school, police said. The transgender person used to go to the woman's workplace and create "nuisance" because the woman had been seeking maintenance from the estranged husband for her child and herself, the official said.
> 
> The school management removed the woman from her job over the "nuisance". Angered over it, the woman decided to kill her estranged husband, police said. As per the plan, the contract killers made the transgender person drink beer and later smothered her to death with pillows in her sleep, police added.
