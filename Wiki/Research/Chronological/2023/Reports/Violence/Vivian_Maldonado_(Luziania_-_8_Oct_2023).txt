stabbed


> Hairdresser Vivian Maldonado, 32 years old, was stabbed to death in Luziânia, on the outskirts of the Federal District. The victim's ex-boyfriend, Matheus de Jesus Rodrigues, aged 20, was arrested and told the police that he killed Vivian after an argument.
> 
> Lawyer Paulo Henrique Cysneiros, appointed to act at the custody hearing, said he requested provisional release because Matheus is a first-time offender, has a good record, fixed residence and legal occupation. The court denied the request.
> 
> The crime took place last Saturday night (7). Matheus told the police that he had known Vivian since he was a child and had a relationship with her. On the day of the crime, he said he went to her house to talk, but they argued.
> 
> “She started causing trouble, calling her neighbor and threatening the suspect and his mother. The suspect called the Military Police (PM), who spoke to the victim [...] as soon as the police officer left, the victim returned, at which point she surrounded him”, describes an excerpt from Matheus's statement.
> 
> After the police left, Matheus said that Vivian hit him with a helmet and he stabbed her. At first, the young man told the police that Vivian “persecuted him” and then said that he committed the crime because he had used drugs.
> 
> The young man was found by the police, had a machete and confessed to having committed the crime, according to the PM.
> 
> Matheus underwent a custody hearing last Sunday (8) and the lawyer asked for his client's provisional release. However, the suspect's arrest was converted into preventative arrest.
> 
> According to judge Nunziata Stefania, who signed the decision, the evidence of authorship was “sufficiently proven” and there is proof of the materiality of the crime




> According to reports, the victim, a trans woman, was bloodied and had “several puncture wounds” on her body
> 
> A 32-year-old trans woman was brutally murdered with a knife in the early hours of this Sunday (8/10). The case took place in Luziânia, on the outskirts of the Federal District.
> 
> The victim's body was found by military police from Goiás (PMGO) on a public road in the Santa Luzia neighborhood, in the city in Goiás. According to reports, she was bloody and had “several puncture wounds”.
> 
> As stated in the police report, the victim was identified by her sister, who indicated Matheus de Jesus Rodrigues as the perpetrator of the crime, with whom the trans woman had had an emotional relationship for 15 years.
> 
> According to the witness, the homicide was possibly motivated “by excessive drug use” on the part of those involved.
> 
> The case is investigated by the Civil Police of Goiás (PCGO).
