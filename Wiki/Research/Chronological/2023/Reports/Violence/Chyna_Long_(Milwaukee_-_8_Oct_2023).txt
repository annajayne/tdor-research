> Police in Milwaukee, Wisconsin have charged 29-year-old Antonio Currin for allegedly murdering Chyna Long, a 30-year-old Black transgender woman, on October 8. Currin reportedly told police that he was at work during the time of Long’s murder, but investigators found proof to the contrary.
> 
> A witness saw a man matching Currin’s description at the site of the murder at 7:47 a.m. local time, just before others reported hearing gunshots in the area. When police arrived, they found that Long had been shot multiple times as she lay dying in the street.
> 
> Video recorded Currin’s tan-colored Chevrolet Impala speeding away from the crime scene. He told police that he had been at work from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the day of the murder. However, police discovered that he actually clocked into his work site at 7:52 a.m. and showed up in his vehicle just three minutes before clocking in, disproving his alibi, The Journal Sentinel reported.
> 
> Investigators also allegedly found bullet casings in his vehicle that matched casings at the murder scene, WISN reported.
> 
> Currin has been charged with first-degree reckless homicide and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Because he was convicted in 2013 for a felony charge of fleeing law enforcement, he was legally forbidden from owning a gun. A judge set his cash bail at $150,000. Police have identified no motive in the alleged shooting.

> Chyna Long, a dance choreographer and Black transgender woman, was shot to death in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on October 8, her family confirmed this week. She was 30 years old.
> 
> Long was killed early Sunday morning around 7:45 a.m. in Milwaukee’s residential Melody Hill neighborhood, according to police statements obtained by local ABC affiliate WISN. No arrests had been made as of Friday.
> 
> “They left my baby there like trash,” Long’s aunt April Gipson said at a vigil held in her memory Thursday. Gipson told mourners that the entire family had been harassed by others for years over her trans identity, and that her killing may have been a hate crime. “We'd get it all the time. And we would just ignore it,” Gipson recalled.
> 
> Chyna’s father Jonathan Long told NBC affiliate TMJ4 that his child was many things, but chief among her passions was dance. “She is a choreographer,” he said. “Since 18 years old, kids came to the house, girls by droves, and she would teach them dancing.” The family has established a GoFundMe to cover funeral expenses, with a service planned for next week.
> 
> Long’s aunt Alissa Davenport told reporters that the person who murdered her niece doesn’t understand the gravity of the crime they committed. “They took a piece of our joy,” Davenport said.
> 
> Long is at least the 28th trans or gender-nonconforming person to die by violence in 2023, according to a running list maintained by Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents. She is also the fifth known Black trans woman to be killed in Milwaukee since last year, following the deaths of Brazil Johnson, Toi Davis, Regina “Mya” Allen in 2022, and Cashay Henderson this past May.
> 
> “You try to be strong but the senseless murders, for whatever reason, we're tired of it,” Davenport told TMJ4. “We've been living in Milwaukee all our lives and we're tired.”
