Transgender found dead in Tambaram
Chennai: A transgender person was found hacked to death in a canal near Tambaram on Monday. Police identified the victim as Dheenadayalan, 50, of Mappedu in Tambaram.

Police said Sanjana, 28, relative of the victim, called Dheenadhayalan to accompany her to a temple festival. Since Dheenadayalan refused to come, Sanjana went alone. Later in the morning she tried reaching Dheenadhayalan, but the call went unanswered. The victim's brother Muthupandi complained to police that his kin was missing.

While they searched for Dheenadhayalan, they found his bike lying near Madambakkam. He was found lying dead with injuries on his body. Selaiyur police sent the body for postmortem.
