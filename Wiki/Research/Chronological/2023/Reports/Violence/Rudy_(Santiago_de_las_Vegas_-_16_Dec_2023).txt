> Havana/ Rudy, a Cuban drag queen known in the LGBTI community as Blancanieves, was murdered this Thursday by his partner, who was arrested shortly after by the police. The crime, which could be classified as femicide when the details are known, occurred in the town of Santiago de las Vegas, in the province of Havana, where the victim lived with Yordano, who caused her a violent death with a knife.
> 
> Following initial investigations, authorities confirmed that the cause of death was a stab wound to the lung. According to Cubanet , a neighbor's testimony states that Blancanieves and Yordano returned home in the early hours of the morning and had a heated argument while Blancanieves' cries for help could be heard. However, no one came to offer help because they claim that the couple repeatedly had heated arguments.
> 
> On Friday morning, after noticing a suspicious attitude on the part of Yordano, who said that Blancanieves had gone on a trip, the neighbors decided to approach the house, where they found the body and immediately called the police. When the aggressor returned to the scene of the crime, they detained him and handed him over to the authorities, according to this version of the events.
> 
> No one came to offer help because they say the couple repeatedly had heated fights.
