stabbed


> The trans community leader Diana Zoe López García was stabbed to death by her partner in a hotel in the Balvanera neighborhood. The woman had worked at Casa Rosa since 2021, with the Trans Labor Quota Law . For the crime, there is one detainee and the Justice plans to include in her charge the aggravating circumstance because it is a transfemicide.
> 
> López García was 47 years old and originally from the province of Salta, she served as president of the Hotel Gondolín, an establishment located in the Villa Crespo area , which houses the transvestite/trans community.
> 
> According to information from Télam , on Saturday she was attacked by her partner, a 38-year-old man identified as Norberto Villegas, who was the one who notified the Police about what had happened.
> 
> In this way, the members of the Neighborhood Police Station 3B of the City Police went to the hotel on Mexico Street at 2300 in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Balvanera. Once at the scene, they found the body of López García, with a sharp puncture wound in the groin. Later, personnel from the Emergency Medical Care System (SAME) confirmed his death.
> 
> Villegas was detained, at the disposal of the National Criminal Correctional Court No. 11. He was charged with the “ qualified homicide ” of the trans community leader, but several aggravating factors are expected to be added as it is a transfemicide.
> 
> The woman had started working at the Casa Rosada in July 2021 after the enactment of the Transvestite Trans Quota Law. The legislation establishes that transvestites, transsexuals and transgender people must occupy at least 1% of positions in the national public sector.
> 
> “On the day of the promulgation, they called me for an interview at the Casa Rosada and that's when they gave me the great news and told me: 'Zoe, you're already hired and that's when my life totally changed,' he said in a video that released the official account of the Presidency to commemorate the sanction of the law.
> 
> In that sense, he reflected: "Before, the Police opened the doors to the cells and patrol cars for me and today they open the door for me to enter my work."
> 
> López García highlighted on more than one occasion the importance of law enforcement. “It is a fight with different organizations, different colleagues, many of them left their lives and could not access the Trans Labor Quota. And I am here to train, to continue studying because that is the opportunity that the Trans Labor Quota gives you,” he expressed.
> 
> In this way, she expressed her intentions that “it will also be the turn of other colleagues” and explained: “There are many of us who want to work and who needed formal and paid work, like everyone else. It is a right and I think we deserve it.”
> 
> Two years after her hiring, Zoe López García referred to the Casa Rosada as a “very important place” and assured that, with her work, she broke “all the barriers” that were imposed on her. “What happened to me I want to happen to them and to everyone,” she confirmed.
> 
> Zoe López García's struggle was long-standing, since she was the director of the Gondolín hotel, a civil association that has 24 years of history. It is a self-managed cooperative that aims to provide shelter and support to those people in the community who have escaped from their provinces or their families.
> 
> After the promulgation of the law, the leader of the trans community also requested that the regulations be expanded to the private sector, so that “comrades can enter private organizations.”
