> In celebration of the 115th anniversary of Umbanda in Brazil, members of the Instituto Carta Magna de Umbanda of the State of Ceará held an event on Wednesday, the 15th, in allusion to the festive date. On the occasion, they also held a walk to combat religious intolerance and physical violence against Umbanda followers. This was the first edition of the event, which intends to be held annually on the date in allusion to Umbanda Day, November 15th. 
> 
> Members of several Umbanda houses in Fortaleza and the Metropolitan Region (RMF) participated in the movement, which began at Praça dos Leões, at 2 pm, and extended to Parque da Criança, ending around 7 pm. 
> 
> On the occasion, the Umbanda followers unanimously asked for respect for the practitioners of this religion, since many of them are unable to practice their religion due to prejudice, as explained by cultural producer Silvia Torres, one of the event's creators. 
> 
> She spoke to the Blog about the case of Babalú, a trans mother of saint, who was shot dead last Sunday, the 12th, in Caucaia. According to Silvia, Babalú was the target of prejudice and intolerance, since she is a follower of the Umbanda religion and is also transgender.
> 
> “In this specific case, you combine two things, right? She was trans and an Umbanda follower. You can’t exercise your life in the slightest, you can’t live. Umbanda and LGBT culture are my flags, so we keep following these things, participating in groups, and we think: ‘People, where are we going?’” he said. 
> 
> “This act is very important both for the religion and for us Umbanda followers, to end this prejudice, because there is a lot of prejudice in our religion”, assessed the father of Santo Roberto, from the Centro de Umbanda Cigano Tubá, about the walk.
