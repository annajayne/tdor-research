> 
> The Bangladeshi human rights organization JusticeMakers Bangladesh called for a prompt investigation and trial of the murderer. The organization gave this account of the crime and what led up to it:
> 
> Nahid, age 20, a trans woman / hajira who was also known as Joyeey Akter Nagini, had worn girls’ clothes from a young ago. A few years ago, she fell in love with a young man named Sajal Chandraw Sankar. Two years ago, they privately exchanged wedding vows but kept their marriage a secret.
> 
> Several months ago, the relationship soured and Sajal asked her to forget him. Shocked, Nagini stabbed herself in the stomach.
> 
> After that, they stayed together until Oct. 7. Then, as they sat at a bus stand, Sajal again asked her to forget him. An argument ensued. Suddenly, Sajal allegedly strangled Nagini with his belt and left her dead body in a field.
> 
> Police arrested Sajal for the murder. Allegedly he initially confessed.
> 
> LGBTQ rights activist and lawyer Shahanur Islam stated that the killing was not an isolated incident in Bangladesh, but is only a small part of the ongoing discrimination, murder, assault and human rights violations against people of the LGBT community, including transgender Bangladeshis, throughout the country. For example, see the article about the Sept. 30 murder of 24-year-old Nila in the capital, Dhaka. (“Latest trans murder in Bangladesh is part of a worldwide problem”)
> 
> Shahanur Islam stated, as he has previously, that although the Bangladesh government has taken some social rehabilitation initiatives by recognizing transgender status as the third gender, those measure are inadequate.
> 
> Moreover, Shahanur Islam says that the LGBT community, including trans people, are continually subjected to human rights violations including discrimination from family, from society and from the state. But most trans Bangladeshis remain invisible to the public due to social unacceptability and intolerance, he said.
