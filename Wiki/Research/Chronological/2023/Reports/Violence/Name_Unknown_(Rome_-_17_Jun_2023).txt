> Crime in Rome: man with wig stabbed to death
> The body found during the night in the Centocelle park. Three days ago a trans woman was injured nearby
> 06.17.2023 11:52
> 
> A corpse with stab wounds to the throat and side. Wearing a women's wig. Of African ethnicity. Found in a park in Centocelle, in via delle Gardenie in Rome. These are the few elements in the hands of the flying squad which must investigate the causes of the death of a man, found at 2.40am on 17 June, at the entrance to Mother Teresa park in Calcutta. The area is often under observation due to the presence of drug dealers and prostitutes.
> 
> The murder of a probable trans man has a precedent, of three days. On June 14, a South American transsexual reported having been injured in the throat by a stranger. She was taken to the Casilino Polyclinic, she then left voluntarily after being treated.





> Who is the man with the wig stabbed to death in the park. Investigations into other violence
> Already in the past the area of Viale Palmiro Togliatti, especially at night, has been the scene of attacks
> 
> He was 40 years old and had arrived in Rome a few months ago from Nigeria. The agents of the Rome flying squad, who are investigating his case, had found his lifeless body in the Mother Teresa of Calcutta park in Centocelle, in Viale delle Gardenie, a month ago. He had no documents with him. He was wearing a blonde wig.
> 
> The investigators, weeks after what is in all respects a murder, have managed to track down some family members. The forty-year-old Nigerian-whose name was not disclosed-was killed with two stab wounds, one in the throat and one on his side of him, on the night of June 17 . A passerby was the first to raise the alarm. The area is frequented by transsexuals and prostitutes who "exercise" along Via Palmiro Togliatti, a few meters away, and it is precisely in this scenario that the police are investigating.
> 
> His killer has not yet been identified and the hunt is on. In fact, those investigating do not rule out that the Nigerian with the blond wig could have been killed by a customer. Maybe after an argument over a payment. A few days before the murder, on June 14, a 43-year-old Colombian trans woman had also been injured after an attack with two blows.
> 
> She had been admitted to the Casilino polyclinic, but never reported the accident. It is not clear at the moment whether the two incidents are connected. Another lead that is not excluded is the one that would lead to the prostitution racket managed by Nigerian crime, which the chief prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi also mentioned in his recent hearing before the anti-mafia parliamentary commission.
