> 
> Valentina de Paz was murdered inside a bar located on 2nd. Avenue "A" and 1a. street in zone 11 of Guatemala City on August 26. The hitman mistook her for another trans girl and shot her, leaving her on the floor. Restaurant managers took her off the street still alive. When the police arrived, according to witnesses, she was asking for help and was drowning. The National Civil Police did not allow them to help her because she "could contaminate the crime scene."

> Both were trans women sex workers.
> 
> With their transfemicides, there are 23 hate crimes recorded against LGBTI+ people in Guatemala so far this year, as Diego Lima from the Lambda Association's Violent Deaths Observatory informed Presentes.
> 
> «Today the 9-day mass was celebrated for Valentina de Paz, a companion murdered and violated in her last moments. By not wanting to provide first aid in a very sad and painful state of agony. Seeing the death of a colleague who gave everything for the Clover Collective, leaving her legacy as a good friend, counselor and a humility that she used to have. Leaving a little piece of love in each heart. and her joy, her spontaneous smile. She was unique, rest in peace, sister and partner in struggle and survival. Some of us teammates joined together to put a small altar in each of her homes in memory of her... see you soon bb. We love you ?? » , they wrote on the Facebook page of the Trans Sex Workers Collective of El Trébol Zona 11 .

> Valentina de Paz was one of the protagonists of the podcast published in this agency: Trans activists from Guatemala fight the system that denies them access to health .
> 
> According to A Presentes Vicky Ventura, coordinator of the Trans Network of the organization Otrans Reinas de la Noche, Cleo had already suffered an attack in 2018. Her relatives had already searched for her at the national morgue (INACIF) that year thinking that they had killed her. . When they found her, Cleo showed signs of torture with knife wounds to her head, face and abdomen.

> In the midst of an election year and international complaints about threats to democracy in Guatemala, the Observatory for Violent Deaths has reported 67 cases of non-homicidal daily violence in 2023 against members of the +LGBTIQ+ community. The departments of Escuintla and San Marcos are the most repeat offenders, while Guatemala and Izabal are the Departments with the most violent deaths.



> Stop the violent deaths of LGBTIQ+ people — RUDA
> “This tragic event reminds us of the urgent need to protect and provide justice to all people, especially those most vulnerable due to their gender expression or identity.” So far this year, there have been 21 violent deaths of people who are part of the LGBTIQ+ community in Guatemala.

> 
> The Collective of trans women and sex workers of El Trébol, in zone 11 of the capital, are dismayed and outraged by the murder of the vice president of that organization, Valentina de Paz, who contributed to and promoted that group. “Valentina was a great person and a great human being,” is how Jeaneth Contreras, president and coordinator of the group, remembers her.
> 
> No one explained to them what happened and why Valentina was murdered. “She was very friendly and she didn't mess with anyone, she got along with everyone, we are still in shock thinking about what happened there.” The Public Ministry went to search for the place where Valentina was murdered, Disco Relax, a bar located on 2nd. Avenue "A" and 1a. street in zone 11. After the murder they closed that bar for two days in a row, they changed the entire façade and even changed the name, something that seems very suspicious to the activists. Apparently, that bar is now called La chancla, but it has no visible name.
> 
>  “There are many issues that do not agree, the murderer did not leave the place, Valentina was taken out of that place without a wig with a bullet wound to the chest. The most outrageous thing is that there are private security guards in the place who also guard the door. Why didn't the guards do anything, why didn't they take out a weapon to defend it? The companion was still dying in the place, asking for water, no one helped her, the firefighters did not arrive,” Jeaneth expressed with evident indignation.
> 
>  She added that they wrote a letter on behalf of all the girls who make up the group, to demand that Valentina's murder not go unpunished. “If you don't follow up on the cases, the authorities close them and they go unpunished,” she added.
> 
> Jeaneth also went to the Public Ministry to file a formal complaint about the incident. Her greatest wish is for it to be clarified and for the authorities to capture the culprit.
> 
>  “We are exposed to different armed and sexual attacks, we are in a vulnerable state, we do not know what can happen right now, there are comments here that will continue to kill trans women, I also discussed this with the Public Ministry, so that they can see why they are killing us. We ask the authorities to look after us,” she reiterated.
