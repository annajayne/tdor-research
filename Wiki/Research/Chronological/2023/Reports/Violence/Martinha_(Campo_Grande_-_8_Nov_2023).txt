> 
> One of the residents of the street arrived at around 1 am, but did not see anything unusual. However, at around 7am, a second neighbor reportedly saw Martinha lying down and, when trying to check if she needed help, noticed the presence of blood in the area around her stomach.
> 
> Therefore, he called the Military Police, who isolated the crime scene and awaited the arrival of the Scientific Police and the Civil Police.
> 
> According to JD1 Notícias , the victim may have been stabbed at another address, as there are blood marks on the asphalt and especially on the sidewalk where she fell.
