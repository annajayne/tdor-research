> NORTHWEST MIAMI DADE, Florida. – There is no indication that a trans woman killed in northwest Miami-Dade on Monday was the victim of a hate crime. However, friends, family and maybe even police may know who killed London Price and that person can be seen on surveillance video moments after the fatal shooting.
> 
> The subject is seen fleeing the crime scene, not far from the crime scene, an apartment on Northwest 93rd Street, with a gun in his hand.
> 
> Nedra Allen said the victim who was shot and killed was her 26-year-old niece.
> 
> Allen said Price was a trans woman. Miami-Dade police officers have not confirmed the name of the victim, only identifying Price as a man who was shot and killed in broad daylight.
> 
> “She would give you the shirt she is wearing. That's what put her in the position to hurt her," Allen said.
> 
> According to her family, the “situation” is that of her ex, who had moved back into the apartment with her. They mention it out loud and in heartbroken posts on social media. Local 10 News is not naming anyone as police have not made any arrests or named any persons of interest.
> 
> “He changed his name, changed his passport, went to court and did everything the right way,” Allen said of Price's transition.
> 
> Local 10 News knocked on the doors of the apartments surrounding Price's home, but there were no answers. No one in the main house responded who could corroborate and compare whether the person in the video is the same person Price loved, with whom she lived, and for whom she may have paid a terrible price.
> 
> The man in question has had run-ins with the law in the past, according to criminal records, but detectives are not saying whether they are focused on him.
> 
> Local 10 News is working to learn more about this case.


> Loved ones are demanding justice after a transgender woman was murdered at her own home in front of her grandmother in northwest Miami-Dade.
> 
> London Price, 26, was killed Monday at the home in the 2900 block of Northwest 93rd Street.
> 
> Family members said Price was first pistol-whipped in front of her grandmother and then shot to death during an argument.
> 
> "I want them to get that animal off the street because he don't belong in a population of human beings, and I want justice to be served for London," said Nedra Allen, Price's aunt.
> 
> Police have made no arrests or identified a possible suspect.



> A person is dead after a shooting in Miami-Dade County, and the victim's aunt believes someone close may have answers.
> 
> Nedra Allen says London Price was the victim in Monday's shooting on Northwest 93rd Street.
> 
> Police identified the victim as a man, but Allen says Price was a 26-year-old trans woman.
> 
> No arrest has been announced, and there's no word on a motive, but Allen thinks Price's ex-boyfriend should be questioned as the two had a troubled past.
