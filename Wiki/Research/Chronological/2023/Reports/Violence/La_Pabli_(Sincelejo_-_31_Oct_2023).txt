> The events occurred last Tuesday, October 31, in the Canarias neighborhood of that city. 
> 
> November 1, 2023. On the night of October 31, a trans woman popularly known as “La Pabli” became the victim of a violent hitman attack in the city of Sincelejo. The incident occurred in the Canarias neighborhood, located in the northeast of the capital of Sucre, leaving the local community shocked and alarmed by the violence experienced in that territory.
> 
> La Pabli's body was found in a remote area of the Canary Islands with a gunshot wound to the forehead, indicating an act of intentional and premeditated violence . This tragic event occurs just a month after La Pabli was the victim of an attack in a stadium in the same sector in September, where she suffered a wound to her arm.
> 
> This new attack raises serious concerns about the safety of LGBTIQ+ people in Sincelejo and highlights the need to take measures to prevent gender-based violence and protect vulnerable people.
> 
> Local authorities have launched an investigation to clarify the circumstances surrounding this tragic event and bring those responsible to justice. We hope that they apply the recent Directive 006, which provides guidelines for the investigation and prosecution of cases of violence against LGBTIQ+ people.
> 
> This incident calls us to ratify the importance of fighting gender violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, as well as the need to guarantee the safety of all people, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.
