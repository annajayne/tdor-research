> 
> "(Delen) immediately surrendered to them (officers). They took him into custody and found a semi-automatic pistol on his person. From that point, they also saw the victim lying on the ground," Bel Air Police Chief Charles Moore told 11 News.
> 
> A court charging document obtained by 11 News said it was all over gender identity.
> 
> "It's a tragic and needless loss of life," Moore told 11 News.
> 
> Those who knew the victim identified her to 11 News as Meghan Lewis. Police charging documents obtained by 11 News state: "Lewis is a transgender woman who has changed her name to Meghan Riley Lewis."
> 
> A neighbor said he had interacted with Lewis before.
> 
> "I did talk to her a few times. We would talk at the pool," the neighbor named Taylor said. "I did hear a loud noise, which I thought might have been a car crash. It wasn't until police showed up that anyone knew anything."
> 
> Police said Lewis was shot in the upper torso and was taken to the University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center, where she died.
> 
> "She was an incredibly bright light and huge asset to the transgender community. She was one of the most decent kind people I've ever known in my entire life," Tina Castle, a friend of Lewis, told 11 News.
> 
> The charging document states Delen was delivering food when he and Lewis got into a confrontation.
> 
> The court record states: "Delen asked, 'Are you waiting for a food delivery, sir?' Lewis took offense to what she believed was Delen misgendering her and began yelling at him."
> 
> The charging document states Delen began to drive away and Lewis followed on foot. Delen then stopped his car and got out, the dispute escalated, and, "during the altercation, Delen produced his firearm and fired one round, striking Lewis in the left abdomen."
> 
> Police charged Delen with second-degree murder, first-degree assault and a gun charge. He remains held at the Harford County Detention Center, and a bail review hearing is scheduled for Friday morning.
> 
> Police send their condolences to the victim's family.
> 
> "We want to guarantee them justice will be served and we will hold Mr. Delen accountable," Moore told 11 News.
> 
> Police are asking for any witnesses to come forward with information or video of the confrontation by calling investigators at 410-638-4500.
