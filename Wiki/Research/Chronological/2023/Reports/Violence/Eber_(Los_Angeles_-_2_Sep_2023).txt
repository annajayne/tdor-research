> The confessed murderer, AACA, is already in preventive detention, after dismembering the body into three parts that he left in different places in the city. Movilh repudiated the crime and requested the intervention of the Ministry of the Interior.
> 
>  A trans man who had been missing since the previous Thursday, É.AO, was murdered by a “friend”, a subject identified with the initials OACA (32) who dismembered the victims into three parts that were abandoned in different parts of Los Angeles. , which is why the Homosexual Integration and Liberation Movement (Movilh) today requested the intervention of the Ministry of the Interior.
> 
> The murderer confessed to the crime after a camera located in the 2 de Septiembre neighborhood of Los Angeles captured him leaving a bag on a street. It was a backpack with two human legs that a neighbor found on Lynch Street last Saturday, two days after the family reported an alleged misfortune.
> 
> “My cousin, Éber, was lost, his closest friends and family had been looking for him since Thursday when he went shopping with the guy who took his life, his friend. They did not have a relationship, nor was she his partner,” the victim's cousin told Movilh.
> 
> He added that my cousin “was cruelly murdered by a man who decided on his fate.”
> 
> The case is being investigated by the Commissioner of the Homicide Brigade, Arturo Fernández, and by the Los Angeles prosecutor, Rodrigo Durán
> 
> “We are in the presence of a brutal, inhuman crime, which, by the way, has the family very hurt. "We have sent all the background information on the case to the Ministry of the Interior so that they can collaborate with the legal and psychological assistance that Eber's relatives require and, most especially, so that they can contribute to clarifying the causes and motive for the murder," said the Movilh spokesperson. , Javiera Zúñiga.
> 
> He added that “in this case we hope that the Prosecutor's Office exhausts all procedures before reaching hasty conclusions. Although the aggressor was a supposed friend or acquaintance of the victim, this alone does not rule out a possible transphobic crime. “LGBTQA+ people suffer violence due to their sexual orientation or gender identity both at the hands of family and friends.”
> 
> Therefore, Zúñiga concluded, “we encourage the police and prosecutors to be rigorous with the case and clarify whether or not there was a transphobic crime, so that they request to apply the aggravating circumstance for hate crimes.”
> 
> Meanwhile, Fudavi, a Biobio organization, is already providing its support to the family, since the facts became known.
