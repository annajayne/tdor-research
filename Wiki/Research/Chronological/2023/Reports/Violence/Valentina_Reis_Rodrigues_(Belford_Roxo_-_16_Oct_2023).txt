> Nail designer Valentina Reis Rodrigues, known as Fabinha, aged 37, died this Monday, one day after being beaten by two men — one of them was a military police officer, according to witnesses — who went to her home, in Xavantes neighborhood, in Belford Roxo, in Baixada Fluminense. According to relatives, the killers are linked to security guards at a market in the region where the victim, a trans woman, stole soap on the 11th.
> 
> — If she stole, they should have called the police. Do not do that. They arrived here calling my son "faggot" and "faggot". That's why I think it (the crime) was motivated by homophobia — said seamstress Luciene Reis, 54, who refers to Valentina in the masculine gender.
> 
> Luciene was at home on the day of the crime. According to her, the nail designer was sitting in front of the gate of the neighboring house, where a child's 3rd birthday was taking place. The two men reportedly said that "the boss" had ordered them to go to the location and one of them said: "We really came to kill."
> 
> — It happened in front of everyone. There were children there. My 10-year-old grandson even fainted,” said the seamstress.
> 
> She was called home. Upon arriving at the scene, the two men who were beating Valentina tried to attack her too. Luciene said that, despite knowing that the suspects could return to her home and being afraid, she will not give up fighting for justice:
> 
> — God sustains me. This crime cannot go unpunished. My son was a happy, cheerful person. He can ask anyone who knew him.
> 
> The case was registered at the 58th DP (Possession). The incident record contains the names of the two men identified as suspects by Valentina's family and relatives. The report from the Medical-Legal Institute states that the cause of death was "traumatic brain injury with hemorrhage" caused by "blunt action". Valentina's burial took place this Tuesday, at the Nova Iguaçu Cemetery.
> 
> The nail designer's death shocked her friends and had repercussions on social media. Posts call for the arrest of the suspects. “They took the life of a trans person because of transphobia,” says one of them.
> 
> Another says that "one mistake does not justify the other": "They caught Fabinha and beat her so much that she ended up in a coma in the hospital and became brain dead, all because of a soap, one mistake does not justify the other. Fabinha committed the crime of theft, but what these community heroes committed was even worse: murder, torture and transphobia."
