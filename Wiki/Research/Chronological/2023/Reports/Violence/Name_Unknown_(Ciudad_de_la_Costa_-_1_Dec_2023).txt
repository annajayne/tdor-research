> 
> We will not expose the comrade out of respect for her memory, family and friends, but we must, in her name and in that of the victims of violent violence, denounce and reject her perpetrators and the ways that cause these crimes to be repeated in our society. and again in conditions of impunity.
> 
> According to the investigation that is still underway, the victim was found in a settlement by the police and her family. The forensic report confirmed that the attack on the companion was disproportionate and savage, in addition to being committed by several people, with terrifying violence and cruelty.
> This is because of the social violence that exists in our society.
> 
> We should not divert attention: it was also a hate crime against a Travesti-trans body. A transfemicide committed between several people and over a prolonged period. Torture is a serious form of physical or psychological pain towards a defenseless and vulnerable person. Clearly the message and action is one of hatred, violence, machismo and harassment. Adding more violence and more hatred to trans bodies that, by living and enjoying their identities, are exposed daily to structural violence, to not being recognized and to not having their identity respected. They are political bodies with the same rights as any other person to live and develop fully.
> 
> It is taking advantage of a person's vulnerable social situation, not only thinking that that life is not valid, but also not thinking that it is as serious as taking their life in such cruel ways that they make people think that there is enjoyment or reward in it.
> 
> These are not isolated cases. These murders are a reflection of a precarious, stigmatized life, plagued by structural, psychological, physical, sexist, and classist violence in a heteronormative society; hate speech and the constant and conscious decision to ridicule or relativize these experiences and trans bodies.
