> Amira O’Neill, 44, was fatally stabbed early Thursday, July 6, in the 2000 block of International Drive in Ypsilanti Township. The stabbing led to a multi-hour standoff after Ronnie Magbray, 27, suspected in the stabbing, barricaded himself in a nearby apartment.
> 
> Magbray was arraigned on one charge of open murder and three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon on Monday, July 10, before Magistrate James Cameron in the 14B District Court. He was denied bond and is next set to appear in court on Thursday, July 20.

> O’Neill grew up in Ann Arbor and lived much of her life in the city, said Alexis O’Neill, 52. But her sibling — the youngest of three — also spent time on “the hippie kind” of communes and co-op living spaces, she said.
> 
> “And she spent time some time with her dad out in California, but those were brief compared to the other 38 years lived in Ann Arbor,” Alexis O’Neill said.
> 
> Amira O’Neill was sporty as a child, playing baseball and skateboarding. Despite learning disabilities that impacted much of her life, she could pick up languages “through osmosis,” Alexis O’Neill said. Amira O’Neill learned Arabic when she began practicing Islam, simply from being around practitioners.
> 
> “I was kind of jealous of it, quite honestly, because I’m a linguist, and it’s a struggle,” Alexis O’Neill said. “I have to work really hard to learn a language, and she picks them up like water.”
> 
> Amira O’Neill, who lived in Ann Arbor at the time of her death, was well known in the community for her willingness to help people, her sister said. When someone was in trouble, she would often show up unprompted to help.
> 
> “She was really the kind of person who was super generous and would help anybody and was always there for other people,” Alexis O’Neill said. “She loved people.”
> 
> Her sibling was always “there for the village,” Alexis O’Neill said. Now, the village is there for them. Her family has seen an outpouring of love and support, she said.
> 
> “(Amira) was definitely an Ann Arbor character,” Alexis O’Neill said, “and well-known and well-loved.”
> 
> Amira was preceded by her father William Currie and nephew Shane Shobey. She is survived by her son Ethan Ostrander, mother Asuki O’Neill, sisters Mary Abrams and Alexis O’Neill, nephews Dillon, Dakota, and Ezra, many cousins, and numerous friends.

> It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of Amira (Hiram Thelonious, Ted) O'Neill, a cherished soul who left the world tragically. She lived a life filled with passion, love, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Amira's journey was one of exploration, growth, and unwavering kindness toward others.
> 
> As a child, Amira's spirit was ignited by the thrill of baseball, the exhilaration of skateboarding, and the joy of playing on the farm. Her infectious laughter and boundless energy brightened the lives of everyone who knew them. Growing into adulthood, her hunger for knowledge blossomed into an unquenchable thirst. She immersed herself in devouring the written word and became an avid reader, an adventurer of the mind, constantly seeking wisdom and enlightenment.
> 
> In her pursuit of knowledge, Amira found solace and guidance in the Islamic faith. She embraced Islam wholeheartedly, finding peace in a connection to a higher power. Her pilgrimage to the Hajj in Mecca and studies in Egypt were a profound and transformational experience, solidifying her faith. Amira's commitment to Islam was marked by a deep reverence for its teaching, fostering a profound sense of compassion.
> 
> Amira was a remarkable transwoman, whose indomitable spirit illuminated the path of self-discovery for so many. She fearlessly embraced her authentic self, teaching us the profound power of self acceptance and inspiring countless hearts to find the courage to live their truth. Her legacy of resilience and strength will forever be etched in our hearts, as we carry for her enduring message of love, compassion, and inclusivity.
> 
> Though Amira's life was filled with moments of joy and light, she also faced significant battles with mental health. Her struggles were arduous, but she found solace and strength in the recovery community. Their unwavering support and understanding became a lifeline, allowing her to navigate through the darkness with a renewed sense of hope, a journey via the remarkable power of love and solidarity.
> 
> Above all, Amira will be remembered for her extraordinary capacity to love, care, and connect with others. Her warmth and genuine compassion knew no bounds. Her infectious laughter, warm smile, and genuine interest in others' lives left an incredible mark on all who had the privilege to know her. She was a remarkable soul, a beacon of love and light extinguished too soon. Amira's legacy will live on through the lives she touched, friendships nurtured, and memories left behind. May her spirit find eternal peace and may her journey continue to inspire us to embrace knowledge, have faith, and show compassion, love, and support to all.
