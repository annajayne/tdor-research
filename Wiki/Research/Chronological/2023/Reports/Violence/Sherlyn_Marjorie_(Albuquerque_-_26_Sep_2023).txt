> 
> According to a news release from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office, on Sept. 26 at approximately 1:20 a.m., deputies responded to a report of a possible deceased person near Central Avenue Southwest and 136th St. SW. When they arrived, deputies were met by a search party looking for a missing transgender woman, 35-year-old Sherlyn Marjorie. They reportedly discovered a body near a ditch, who they believe is Marjorie.
> 
> The Sheriff’s Office said detectives "pursued multiple leads, executed search warrants, and meticulously analyzed surveillance footage."
> 
> Through their efforts, the Sheriff’s Office identified Jose Juan Mendoza Espinoza as the primary suspect, and officials obtained a search warrant for his home.
> 
> During an interview with investigators, Espinoza reportedly "admitted to being in a clandestine sexual relationship with Ms. Marjorie," and he allegedly paid her to stay quiet about it.
> 
> According to the Sheriff’s Office, Espinoza confessed that he killed Marjorie "after she allegedly threatened to disclose their relationship to his family."
> 
> The Sheriff’s Office said evidence found at Espinoza’s residence supported his confession and aligned with the timeline of events.
> 
> On Wednesday, Oct. 11, Espinoza was booked into the Bernalillo County Jail on one count of first-degree murder and four counts of tampering with evidence.
> 
> The Sheriff’s Office noted that at this time, "There is no evidence to suggest or reason to believe that this incident was a hate crime specifically targeting individuals in the transgender community."
