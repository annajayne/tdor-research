> ...the murder of a 45-year-old person with non-binary trans life experience, known among his relatives and relatives as 'Consejito', also occurred in San Antonio, Tolima. According to preliminary information, the victim received three shots that ended his life and his body was found with other signs of violence. Apparently, the victim was approached after 8:00 pm, once she left work. We hope that these acts of violence are investigated and clarified, being prioritized by the Attorney General's Office. Also hoping that the local authorities take pertinent actions to guarantee the life and integrity of LGBTIQ+ people, especially the recently recognized subject of collective reparation.
