> 
> Friends and people close to Manu say that she had been treated as a woman for years, and that she had rectified her documents. Even so, it was her name on her certificate that was placed on her tombstone.
> 
> Manu disappeared on the night of December 28 after experiencing a psychotic episode, according to the friend who filed the police report.
> 
> In the police record, the friend said that she lived with Manu and that when she arrived home, her colleague displayed aggressive behavior, and that she tried to grab a knife to attack her.
> 
> After that, the trans woman would have jumped from the 2nd floor and disappeared. Registration was made on December 30th. On this date, the body was already at the Campo Grande Legal Medical Institute, since it was found on the Bangu railway line on December 29th.
> 
> According to the Military Police, police officers from the Railway Group were called to an incident of finding a body. The investigation was called and the incident was forwarded to the 34th DP (Bangu).
> 
> Manu's body spent four days without identification at the IML , until family members managed to recognize her on Tuesday (2).

> 
> Alerj's first transgender deputy follows the case. Dani Balbi (PCdoB) states that he seeks justice for Manu.
> 
> "Another transsexual and transvestite person was brutally murdered. Manu's death, like so many others, cannot go unpunished. She was killed when she was less than 30 years old, she had a lot of life ahead of her, her dreams were cut short" , he explains.
> 
> “In Brazil, the life expectancy of the trans population is 35 years , which is absurd. This needs to end. And, finally, it is important that the family of the transsexual and transvestite population respects their gender identity”, adds the parliamentarian.
> 
> Gab Van, president of the Transmasculine League, accompanied the procession, with six other LGBTQIA+ rights activists, and also demanded justice.
> 
> "How many more of us will die because of transphobia? Often, family members don't see that by disrespecting our gender identity and our name, they are setting us up to suffer violence and be killed in the street. Disrespecting us is also a symbolic death ", reinforces Gab Van.
> 
> According to Jonatan Neves, the family did not have assistance from friends in searching for the body and burial. He states that Manu had never asked family members to address her as feminine.
> 
> “He never spoke like Manu, at Christmas he was here with us, playing and always being addressed [by his given name] and responding normally. We found out that his name was Manu because of these posts”, says the brother-in-law.
> 
> He states that after December 25th, they no longer saw the victim and only found out about his disappearance on the 30th.
> 
> The brother-in-law also denies that Manu had rectified the documents.
> 
> “It was not an accident, it was clear that it was a homicide. My question is 'who did this'? We just want justice”, reinforces the brother-in-law.
