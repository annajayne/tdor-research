Naresh, Sunil and Neelu used to do the work of taking greetings from auto. After Neelu left, both of them became unemployed. Naresh used to love Neelu Kinnar. Because of which he wanted to bring her back. But Neelu liked her new friend. That’s why she did not return even after the king asked her several times. The king was very upset by this. Naresh planned to make one last attempt with Sunil. Naresh took Sunil with him and made a plan that first he will make Neelu understand and convince her by making her drink alcohol but if she still doesn’t agree then he will kill her. When Neelu Kinnar did not return, both the miscreants together killed her and burnt her body.

> Jaipur: The Jaipur police on Sunday arrested three persons for allegedly killing a 25-year-old transgender woman and setting her body on fire in Kanota.
> The Jaipur police have identified the accused as Naresh Kumar alias Narsi (33), Suneel Bhaat (22), and Suraj Meena (19).
> 
> The police have identified a failed love affair as the primary motive behind the murder of the victim, Neelu (25). Her partially burned body was discovered in Kanota on Friday.
> In their statements on Sunday, the police revealed that Kumar and Neelu had been in a relationship for the past five years. However, Naresh had grown suspicious of Neelu's involvement with another person, which had angered him.
> 
> The police also discovered that the two had frequent quarrels. On Thursday, when all four of them were travelling in a car, an argument escalated, leading to Kumar punching Neelu in the face. Neelu began bleeding and was in pain. Subsequently, the accused used a small rope from a dholak to strangle her and then placed her body in the trunk of their car.
> The accused then obtained five litres of petrol in a jerrican, which they used to pour onto the victim's body before setting her on fire.
> 
> According to the police, the victim's body was severely burnt, with over 90 per cent of it consumed by the fire, leaving only a portion of the face recognizable. “This made it challenging for the police to identify the victim. Consequently, the police issued a search request throughout Rajasthan and published a photo of the deceased in newspapers,” said the statement.
> 
> The police also reviewed CCTV footage from the incident site, the main market, petrol pumps, and toll booths. Through the analysis of CCTV footage and information gathered from informants across the city, the police identified the victim and arrested the accused.
