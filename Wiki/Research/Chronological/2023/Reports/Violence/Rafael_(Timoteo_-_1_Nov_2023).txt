> According to Lieutenant Silvino, from the Timóteo Military Police, Rafael had been receiving threats from Rodrigo da Silva Campos, 36 years old, who lived in the same housing complex as him. "In recent weeks, the two have had friction. The author began to threaten Rafael and said he was going to send him and his family away from the condominium. In fact, Rafael even moved out of there and went to live with his girlfriend in another place, but in the same neighborhood. Today, the perpetrator managed to fire a few shots and the victim jumped over the wall of another house to try to escape," said the soldier.
