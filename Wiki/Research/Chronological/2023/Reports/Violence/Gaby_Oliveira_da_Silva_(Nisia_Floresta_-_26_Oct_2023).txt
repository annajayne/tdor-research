murdered


> Augusto César Oliveira da Silva, better known as Gaby, a transvestite, has been missing since [October] 15th. The case happened after she arranged a meeting via social media, in Nísia Floresta, in Greater Natal. According to the chief delegate of Nísia Floresta, José Medeiros, after the case was publicized in the press, some people began to report it, and with the new information the line of investigation changed.
> 
> “Before we worked along the lines of a crime of passion, perhaps a crime of transphobia, but with the new information the perspective changed a little. Someone would have tried to schedule a program on Instagram with her, and she went. We tried to access these messages that were exchanged, but they were deleted remotely.”
> 
> Medeiros explained that after this confirmation, the team tried to locate the car she got into, based on the characteristics that were mentioned. “We tried to take some images close to the site, but it was very difficult, because we don't have a sign, just some general characteristics. A crime recently occurred with a car that had similar characteristics,” said the police chief.
> 
> This crime took place in a neighboring municipality, and as a result, the team from the Technical-Scientific Institute of Forensics (Itep-RN) went to the scene and carried out an examination of the car, finding blood inside the vehicle. “The blood of this homicide victim was found, but there was also blood on the back, and it looked a little older. Which would make sense to be Gabi’s, who disappeared on the 15th”, says the delegate.
> 
> José Medeiros also said that “it is not yet known what kind of connection these crimes have, but the biological material was collected and sent to Itep, which will now go to the laboratory – for genetic expertise, and should take about two weeks to have this result, which will be to confirm or rule out being Gabi’s.”



> Augusto César Oliveira da Silva, better known as Gaby, a transvestite, has been missing since last Sunday (15). The incident happened after she arranged a meeting on social media and got into an unknown car, but since then, she has not been seen again.
> 
> Gaby lives in Nísia Floresta, in Grande Natal, and works selling snacks with a friend. According to her mother, who preferred not to identify herself, the young woman left around 10 am and has never been in the habit of not giving updates on where she is.
> 
> “We don't know who this person is, we don't have any information. When he leaves, he always calls me. Disappearing like that never happened. It's been very difficult for the whole family. I want to know where my son is, he is everything to me. In the name of Jesus, whoever saw him ask him to contact me, wherever he is I will look for him. I don’t know what my life will be like without my son.”
