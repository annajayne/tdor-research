> MÉRIDA, YUC.- November 9.- The alleged suspects and the vehicle they used to take the body of a transvestite to dump it on the Molas-San José Tzal road have been fully identified. Agents of the State Investigation Police (PEI) of the Public Security Secretariat (SSP) in coordination with the State Attorney General's Office (FGE) will request from a control judge arrest warrants against those likely responsible for dumping the body of a man on a stretch of road in the Molas police station, last Tuesday.
> 
> The investigating agents and prosecutors were able to fully identify the alleged suspects, as well as the vehicle in which the body was transported from a property in the center of Mérida where the individual was allegedly killed and where they executed a search warrant.
> 
> As part of the investigation, PEI agents interviewed various people in order to obtain information that would help clarify the events. The motives that led to the events were due to conflicts between the now deceased and his assailants and are not related to organized crime.
