> 
> The president of the Association of New Men and Women of Panama, Ricardo Beteta, revealed that five gays and two trans people have been murdered from 2023 to 2024, highlighting an increase in the number of crimes against members of the LGBT community.
> 
> In an interview with Radio Panama, Beteta reported that there are many male predators who pretend to be homosexuals to take advantage of, steal, blackmail, extort and physically harm their victims.
> 
> "It is a complex issue, because it has to do with the flirting they have on social networks, where many gays do not have a perception of risk. This issue of murders is the pinnacle of this whole issue," said Beteta.

> In this sense, she sent a clear message to the members of her community, emphasizing that if they enter these networks, they should look for warning signs in case the person does not have a profile photo, is reluctant to show their face, that without knowing them they ask them if they live alone, ask them where they work and insist on having dates in inappropriate or isolated places.
> 
> "I would like to have a dialogue with the police to prevent this and not fall into crimes on social networks. Tinder, Ginder and Rowlet have a fairly large culture of sexuality," she says.
