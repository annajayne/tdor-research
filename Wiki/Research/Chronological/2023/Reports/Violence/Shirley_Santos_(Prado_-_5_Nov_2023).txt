> On the tragic Sunday, November 5th, terrible news shook the peaceful town of Prado. Jamilton Santos Silva, known as “Shirley Santos”, aged 52, a transsexual woman who worked as chef in a beach hut in the city center, and young Carlos Luiggi do Nascimento, just 20 years old, were victims of a brutal attack inside the house they lived in, located on the busy Avenida Minas Gerais, in the São Brás neighborhood, one of the largest and most populous in the region. According to reports from the victims' neighbors, the night became dark when armed criminals invaded the place and fired several shots at close range.
> 
> The tragedy becomes even more distressing when we observe that, faced with imminent danger, Jamilton and Carlos tried to escape, but, given the small size of the house, the attackers found it easy to carry out the terrible crime. The authorities, through the regional duty of the 8th Interior Police Coordination (Coorpin/Teixeira de Freitas), authorized the removal of the bodies to the Legal Medical Institute of Itamaraju, while the authorship and motivation of this shocking attack remain unknown. At the time of the attack, the gas stove remained lit, and pans waited at the cooking point, a sad reminder of the lives cut short and the dreams that were extinguished on that fateful night.
> 
> This act of violence shocks not only the local community, but also reminds us of the urgent need to combat intolerance and violence directed at LGBTQ+ people around the world. Society must come together to ensure that everyone can live their lives safely, respectfully and equally, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation. As investigations progress, we hope that justice is served and that Shirley and Carlos' legacy is remembered as a call for change and empathy, so that tragedies like this do not happen again.
