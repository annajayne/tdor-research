> Campanilla (Codificación Runa Sipiy CPTSX002213923), a 28-year-old young woman, lost her life in a hitman style attack according to information collected by our organization. The incident was characterized by the execution of two shots to the victim's head, which instantly caused her death. The secrecy surrounding this case is notable, as the family is immersed in fear and uncertainty due to the nature of the crime and the possible threats that may fall on them. Until now, the family has chosen to remain silent, contributing to the proliferation of multiple hypotheses surrounding the terrible murder.
> 
> The police authorities arrived at the scene to remove Campanilla's body. The police also attempted to gather evidence and carry out a thorough investigation to clarify the details of this crime and bring those responsible to justice.
> 
> We call on the relevant authorities to fully engage in the investigation of this case and ensure that justice is served. This tragic event underscores the importance of decisively addressing violence against trans and gender non-binary people, as well as ensuring the safety and protection of their families and LGBT+ people.
> 
> For what has been described, we call on the Attorney General of the State, Diana Salazar, the Commander of the Police, Fausto Salinas Samaniego, the Minister of the Ministry of Women and Human Rights, Paola Flores, the Undersecretary of Diversities, Alexander Guano, the Ombudsman of the People of Ecuador (e), Cesar Córdoba Valverde, to carry out the necessary coordination to find the person or persons responsible for this fact. At present, nearly twenty-two murders have been recorded against our LGBT+ populations so far in 2023.
