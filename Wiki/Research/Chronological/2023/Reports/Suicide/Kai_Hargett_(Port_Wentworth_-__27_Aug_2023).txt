> Hi my name is Macayle I’m fundraising to get a headstone for my girlfriend Kai who committed suicide in August of 2023 and all she has is a metal plate that came from the funeral home and she was transgender and she had adhd and autism and her grandmother doesn’t have the money to get her a stone so I want to get one. Anything helps and thank you

> Kai was funny, smart, talented and generous. She loved music and dabbled in many aspects as a self-taught musician of numerous instruments. She enjoyed vintage records, composing & singing using her formal training or playing by ear. Always the creator and builder she made many fully functional Cos-Play & Halloween costumes complete with gear like a dragon costume with a working jaw & a slithering tail or the to-scale Samori sword. All made from cardboard boxes, spray paint, old clothes & scraps around the house with a glue gun, needle and thread. Kai's daily go-to was art across mediums: sketching, drawing, painting, and sculpting.
