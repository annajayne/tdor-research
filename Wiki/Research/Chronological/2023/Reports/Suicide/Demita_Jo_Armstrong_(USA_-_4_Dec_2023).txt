> I believe that Demita Jo Armstrong died of suicide. She has a bunch of accounts, and her funeral was last week, but I am not finding a lot of information.



Hello my name is Earline Budd, known as the advocate. Again, we find ourselves reaching out for the communities help. Today I am starting a fundraiser to help with services for Demita Armstrong gone too soon. Demita was a sweet heart and a good person. Demita just a few months ago loss her mother, and constantly said that she was so badly to be with her. Demita struggled day in and day out with mental health which can be a barrier in one's life. Often talking with Demita she saw life as her enemy and death as her friend. We she too has gotten her wings and flown away to the heavenly home. Rest in peace Demita and know that the LBGTQ community will miss you. Please find in yor heart to give to Demita Joe's fundraiser and help bring closure to her life.
