> We are sad to share that, at the end of June 2023, artist and disability justice practitioner and consultant Rebel Sidney Black (aka Rebel Fayola Rose) died by suicide. Rebel was part of the Disability Justice Leaders Collaborative from 2017-2019. He was also a leader for several different disability justice projects, including PDX Disability Justice Collective, CripCreate, Disability Justice Dreaming, and in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a pod mapping tool that gained national recognition by disability communities and beyond. You can see more of Rebel’s writing and work here.

> We know our systems of health care, housing, public benefits and philanthropy are not designed to support our disabled community members. We know, due to ableist systems, the life expectancy and quality of life for disabled people is significantly lower than it is for nondisabled people. Rebel sought to change that and started by organizing in his community through relationships, building networks and by dreaming.

> We miss you, Rebel.

> memories from Dom Chatterjee:
> Rebel's involvement was critical to bringing QTPoC Mental Health online, especially in creating a Facebook group. We were friends in another virtual mental health space and poured ourselves into addressing problems there without seeing change; it was clear QTIBIPOC needed community-only places to communicate about our emotional wellbeing and traumas.
> Rebel’s radical honesty is unmatched. As a light-skinned multiracial Black person, Rebel often questioned his place in QTIBIPOC spaces; yet her presence and advocacy efforts created support for so many of us.
> Rebel is featured in The Future is Disabled by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha.
> Rebel died by suicide June 2023.

> Share a memory with us about a trans loved one who passed on due to violence.
> Tag a community member who is still alive to tell them you appreciate them. Spend time holding each other’s feelings. Learn new practices from each other. Redistribute resources.
> Celebrate each other’s wins. Share in each other’s losses. Make space for each other’s pain. Notice who is missing.
