> It is with heavy hearts that we announce the sudden and untimely passing of Hailey "Bee" Mackenzie Lawson on the afternoon of May 2, 2023.
> 
> Bee lived life fully – they enjoyed making other people laugh and were nothing short of amazing. Bee could light up a room with their ridiculousness and had a mind of their own. Bee was a very talented writer and thoroughly enjoyed reading, as well as art, binge watching tv series, collecting monster cans, and sometimes causing a little mayhem. There was never a dull moment with Bee around. Bee also loved her friends to a fault and loved going out for crazy fun-filled adventures.
> 
> Bee has many friends and family that will miss them deeply. Bee was a unique personality that people couldn’t help but be drawn to. Bee was quirky, funny, a little outrageous, and never hesitated to speak exactly what was on their mind. They were blunt and vulgar, but the most fun to be around in so many ways.
> 
> It is often those who seem the happiest who are the saddest inside; Bee struggled with depression and mental health for several years and tried to keep going, but Bee just could not handle the pain they felt inside anymore. This world was too harsh a place for a soul so full of life and love.
> 
> Bee is survived by their mother, Sarah Mackenzie, their sister and brother: Peyton and Jonny Lawson their father: Kyle Lawson (Kaela Lawson), and their son: Alex Lawson. Bee is also survived by their maternal grandma: Rhonda Rowe and their aunt: Amy Marcotte (Anuj). Bee is predeceased by their maternal grandfather: Alistair Mackenzie (Ann Mackenzie– and her children Nicole, Jenna and Reuben). Bee is also survived by their paternal grandparents: Patricia and Jim Lawson, their aunt: Sarah (Mike) Horlsen, and their children: Kayla, Ashleigh, Daniel and Hannah. Bee will also be fondly remembered by their great grandmas: Liz Mackenzie and Lois Rowe along with all their great aunts, uncles, cousin and friends.
> 
> Bee will be greatly missed, but never forgotten. Their memory will live on through the lives of others. Rest easy my sweet bumble bee.
>
> Memorial donations may be made to Rebel Cat Rescue, Regina Cat Rescue, or Camp Fyrefly as gifts of remembrance. Floral donations are welcome; Bee's favourite flower was a sunflower.

> Moments before the Saskatchewan Party government dropped a bill even it grudgingly admits might add to existing mental health issues facing transitioning kids, it was confronted by the ugly realities of this issue.
> 
> Before the Parents’ Bill of Rights Act was officially introduced in the Saskatchewan Legislature Chamber, government MLAs heard in question period the story of Regina mom Sarah Mackenzie, whose 14-year-old non-binary child “Bee” did not received the mental health counselling support she needed.
> 
> She died by suicide in May.
> 
> Such a juxtaposition of perspectives in the assembly is often alarming. But there are days like Thursday when this contrast is disturbing. It’s downright nauseating that the government hasn’t really asked how its bill may hurt a kid like Bee more than it helps.
> 
> Of course, there would be no controversy with Bill 137 if it only emphasized parents’ “rights” to have an active role in their children’s education — what the government claims this bill is really about.
> 
> How much controversy is there over a parent being “informed of the conduct and administrative policies” or “informed and consulted in relation to a pupil’s school attendance problems,” as is prescribed in the new legislation?
> 
> Maybe there isn’t even as much controversy as some people think with parents having to be informed of sexual education presentations two weeks in advance, or being able to withdraw their child simply through written consent. (Although with the number of teen pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases in this province, it’s difficult to understand how not teaching young adults about such issues would be considered a good thing.)
> 
> But most of us get that a bill likely becomes problematic when it immediately calls for use of the notwithstanding clause to override the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code.
> 
> Or, at least, many of us wouldn’t be as cavalier as Education Minister Jeremy Cockrill and others in the Sask. Party when it comes the notion that the rights of adult parents automatically supersede the rights of kids like Bee who are simply struggling to survive.
> 
> There again, after being warned by teachers, child psychologists, lawyers, the Children’s Advocate and a Court of King’s Bench justice of the “irreparable harm” the new law poses, most of us might want to slow down passage of such a law to ensure it does no harm.
> 
> That was the approach of former premier Brad Wall, who preached to his caucus to “leave the province better than we found it.”
> 
> “On what planet can they argue this is urgent?” asked NDP Opposition House Leader Nicole Sarauer in talking out the clock on Thursday so that those who might have concerns over the content of this legislation might have at least a few more days to examine it.
> 
> The NDP justice critic noted that the Saskatchewan’s Children’s Advocate is concerned that 94 per cent of Saskatchewan transgender kids surveyed said they have had mental health issues lasting a year or more while two-thirds are reported to have contemplated suicide.
> 
> “So what do they (the government) do when they hear that? They alienate them further,” Sarauer said.
> 
> Most days, it’s hard to understand why politicians in the assembly are not moved by reasoned arguments from across the floor. But it becomes really unfathomable when you hear about Bee — a sweet kid born and named Haley on Feb. 23, 2009, who lost her complex battle with addictions while transitioning in an already unsupportive world.
> 
> “I want to know why there continues to be funding cuts for proper mental health supports, especially for adolescents,” said Sarah Mackenzie early Thursday. “Why aren’t there more resources in place, more supports? Why are people going to the hospital saying, ‘I’m at the end of my rope, I can’t live anymore’ being turned away or convinced that they’re OK?”
> 
> Isn’t it a parental right to get answers to such questions? Shouldn’t the government have those answers before it rams through legislation that potentially puts more kids like Bee at risk?
