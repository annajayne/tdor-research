> It is with incredible sadness that we announce the passing of Aurora Claire Stark (42), of Kâ€™jipuktuk (Halifax), on February 16, 2023. Aurora was born December 30, 1980. The eldest sibling, she was a happy, sweet and a spoiled child. She spent her high school days as the singular goth scene in her small town of Liverpool where she was born and raised. Aurora has touched many lives. She was a tireless activist for the queer, trans and disabled communities. Using her razor wit and boundless compassion, she endeavored to help forge a vision of a better world. She offered space when she had so little, money when she had even less, and always her love, of which she never seemed to run out. She was relentlessly committed to growing and healing, in her journey to love herself and others. Farewell to you bright, gentle, amazing  woman. For you we live on. Survived by her parents, Brenda Foster (Murphy) and Allan Foster; her brothers, Matthew and Nick; as well as by her queer, trans, mad, and disabled family and community;  her aunts and uncles, Robie Murphy, Marilyn Murphy and Carol Pierce; her grandmother, Joyce Foster; aunts and uncles, Ken Foster, Jan Hanson, Darryl Foster, Greig Foster, Gail Davison; and many more. Predeceased by Sadie Galsworthy; and her uncle, Robert Murphy; aunt, Sandra Ross; grandparents, Florence and Arthur Murphy; and grandfather, Ted Foster. Her service will be in Cruikshank Funeral Home on March 24th at 1 p.m. To be followed by a Memorial at Point Pleasant.
