> Relentless Bullying Led Trans Teen To Take Their Own Life – Now Parents Are Suing Alabama School District

> It was bad enough that “S.W.”, with mixed-race heritage, had been harassed by white students since elementary school. Then in 7th grade, the Alabama student came out as gay and gender-neutral, requesting to be called “Shane” and to be addressed by “they/them” pronouns. When S.W. came out as trans, what followed was a barrage of abuse and mockery, by both students and teachers—so bad that it ultimately drove S.W. to their death at the age of 14 on August 9, 2023. 
> 
> Now, the parents are suing Elba City Board of Education plus two past principals of Elba High School, Wynn Grimes and Warren Weeks.
> 
> According to the lawsuit filed August 8th, S.W. was also “bullied and mocked for assuming traditionally male appearance in terms of manner of clothing and hairstyle.” Their English teacher and science teacher also actively participated by mocking and belittling S.W.’s gender identity naming requests.
> 
> The inaction of school officials rose well beyond indifference. In April 2023, S.W. was hospitalized for mental health treatment related to suicidal ideation caused by the bullying. Carmeisha Williams, S.W.’s mother, informed then-Principal Wynn Grimes of S.W.’s mental health status and asked him to take action. Despite being aware of S.W.’s protected characteristics–race, gender identity, sexual orientation, and mental health disability–”Defendants made a conscious decision not to remedy the harassment directed at S.W.,” the suit states. 
> 
> Furthermore, officials failed to provide bullying reporting forms on the school’s website and in the school’s student handbook, as required by law; instead forms were kept under lock and key in the principal’s office where only Grimes had access.
> 
> It’s difficult to imagine how S.W. could have coped with any of this, much less what followed. After returning to school post-hospitalization in April, “In a stunning display of cruelty, Students mocked S.W.’s mental health status, calling them ‘crazy’ and telling them they ‘should try better next time’ to kill themselves,” the suit states.  
> 
> In August, former principal Warren Weeks went on to scream at S.W. in front of about 50 students and forcibly removed a hoodie that S.W. wore to conceal self-inflicted scars on their body, revealing both scars and the outline of their breasts. Weeks then forced S.W. to attend classes in an emotionally devasted state on August 8th. 
> 
> One day later, S.W. took their life by suicide.
> 
> Sadly, S.W.’s family had tried to withdraw them from the school and all its horrors. Officials were well aware of the brutalities, but refused and told the family: “no matter where they go, it will follow them.”
> 
> The suit, in a portion appropriately titled “Prayer for Relief”, demands a trial by jury; a declaration that Defendants’ acts and practices violated Title IX, Title VI, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); compensatory damages for mental anguish and emotional distress, loss of companionship and society, medical and psychological treatment expenses, funeral and burial expenses and other; and improvements in protocols, anti-bullying and anti-discrimination policies, and mandatory training for staff.
