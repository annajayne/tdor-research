suicide



> We've got reports of two trans youths who were lost to suicide this year, Molly, 14, and Kalle, 14. It's reported in the articles that the cause of Molly's despair was being stuck in a queue waiting for her first contact at a trans healthcare clinic. Kalle was placed into a compulsory care home for troubled girls in spite of insisting on being treated as the young man he was, and was routinely placed in isolation for unclear reasons, where he took his life.

> That's what Kalle, 14 years old, told his emergency family in May.

> 
> Kalle, 14, took his own life at SIS home - this is how the family wants to honor the memory
> Kalle is described as curious, quick-thinking and creative. A person who found it easy to learn new things and was liked by everyone. Kalle was born a girl and was named Kayla, but already at the age of 8 began asking her mother questions about gender identity.
> 
> - I have always tried to support and answer the questions, even if they were sometimes difficult, says mother Zanele.
> 
> She says that Kalle, who was still called Kayla at the time, was sexually assaulted by three older guys shortly before.
> 
> - The abuse was discovered by the school, because the boys talked about it. The boys allegedly told my child "if you want to play with us you have to do this and this" and then the abuse happened, says the mother.
> 
> She noticed that Kalle felt bad mentally after the abuse, and tried to support as much as she could. At the same time, Kalle continued to be curious and interested in discussing deeper and more complex issues, such as identity.
> 
> Kalle loved animals, and mother Zanele bought two cats.

> - It so happened that Kalle sought out older children and that's where the problems eventually started when they got older, says the mother.
> 
> The other children started trying alcohol and Kalle, who had a lack of impulse control, got hooked - and discovered that it was a way to numb the anxiety.
> 
> Mother Zanele turned to BUP and social services for help. At BUP, Kalle was diagnosed with ADHD and depression, and together with the social secretary at the time, Zanele decided that Kalle should try to come away to a family home to break destructive patterns.
> 
> "Be a calm guy"
> - From the beginning we had a fantastic social worker who really tried to understand my child and help us. But then she stopped and then it got bad, says Zanele.
> 
> Instead of feeling better, Kalle's destructive behavior accelerated. Kalle ran away, drank alcohol and tried various forms of drugs. The social service writes in its application for compulsory care that "Kalle exposes himself to danger through socially destructive behavior in the form of a vagabond lifestyle" and mentions, among other things, that Kalle had an 18-year-old girlfriend.

> - I understood that my child needed compulsory care in order to receive help, but they told me that the placement would be in a treatment home. Nothing about Sis, Zanele says.
> 
> The first emergency placement was an emergency home where the family says they liked Kalle a lot.
> 
> - My first impression was that Kalle was a calm guy. He came in straight away and sat down and petted our dog, who also liked him very much, says emergency home mother Katrin Kullabo.
> 
> "Was a shock"
> The two weeks that Kalle should have been placed in emergency care with the family turned into three months. At home, Kalle primarily played music, and was self-taught in both piano and guitar at an advanced level for a 13-year-old. The foster family did not experience the usual challenges that often exist with children who are placed because of their own behavior.
> 
> - It worked very well with Kalle and we had nice conversations. But he constantly had this anxiety that he wouldn't be allowed to stay but would be locked up. I could see that he felt very bad from that worry and that it was the one that made him run away, says Katrin.
> 
> Kalle didn't like being in pictures, and didn't like looking at himself in the mirror.  "He hated showering and having to see his body," says the daughter in the on-call family.

> The on-call mother had heard that Kalle would be allowed to come to a unit within the State Board of Institutions (Sis) with expertise in gender dysphoria and trauma.
> 
> - It was a shock for me when I understood that they transported him to a completely different institution that was much further away, says Katrin.
> 
> Despite the fact that Kalle wanted to be a boy, and at his own request is referred to as "he" in all decisions about compulsory care, Kalle is placed at the Folåsa institution for girls .
> 
> In the beginning, Kalle called mother Zanele's home and asked for help and told her that there were staff who were stupid and mocking.
> 
> - When it comes to children who are searching for their identity, then there needs to be trained staff. Kalle was not accepted as a person by everyone, says Zanele.
> 
> Didn't answer when mom called
> The institution Folåsa has recently received sharp criticism from Ivo precisely for shortcomings in safety and security. According to the mother, Kalle was cared for in isolation, but she says it should be called isolation.
> 
> - Only one hour a day was Kalle allowed to hang out with other children, the rest of the time Kalle, who has ADHD and a great need to move around, was confined to a small space.
>

> Aftonbladet has taken part in texts written by Kalle. There, the fight against the "demons" is described, how Kalle feels that the mental suffering is not taken seriously and that Kalle is called childish.
> 
> On August 6, Kalle was found dead by suicide in his room at the Sis home. Mother Zanele only got the news half a day later.
> 
> - I tried to call Folåsa the same evening it happened because I had a missed call, but then they didn't answer. When I called the next morning, they said to call the police instead, but not why.
> 
> Zanele put herself in a telephone queue for 11414. A few hours later, a patrol came with the death warrant.
> 
> Kalle, 14, died at Sis' home Folåsa on August 6 after being placed with Sis for just under 8 weeks.  With his fingers he forms half a heart.

> Dreamed of helping others
> - I had so many questions and the police could not answer any of them. When I call Folåsa, I have received different answers each time about what happened. I want to know who was with Kalle before it happened, if it was the staff who mocked my child, says Zanele.
> 
> She wants to tell Kalle's story so that other children with the same problem will get the right help. Kalle also described that as a future dream in his diary – to be able to help others.
> 
> - We fought for Kalle to get treatment and find himself. But my child never got help.
> 
> For Zanele, a new battle has just begun. Coping with grief.
> 
> - I'm going to order a tombstone that says Kalle on it, because it was Kalle that my child wanted to be called.
