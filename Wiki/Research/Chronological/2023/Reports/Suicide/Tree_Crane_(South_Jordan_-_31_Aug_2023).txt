> Tree Crane who was from Utah passed away at the end of August. I believe he died of suicide.



> my heart is so broken. my entire world just got flipped upside down. 
>
> i miss you. i miss your laugh. i miss your humor. i miss talking to you everyday, telling you my every thought. i miss spending every moment with you. i miss you being my personal uber driver. i miss you taking me places i would’ve never went to on my own. i miss you being smarter than me. i miss you making me mad. god, i’d do anything to be mad or annoyed with you again because that would be better than this. i wish i could’ve saved you the same way you saved me numerous times. 
there is no doubt that i failed you. i miss our friendship. 
>
> wherever you went, i hope you’re happier there. and i hope you don’t regret a thing. if this had to happen, i hope you are at least at peace now. 
> 
> i love you Tree. It’s your world now.
