> 
> A nonbinary teen died by suicide in Timmins last April.
> 
> 
> The 14-year old, who was born a boy but also identified as a girl, was best friends with Ward 5 Coun. Cory Robin’s son.
> 
> Robin shared the story of Kaleisha (Clay) Douglas for the first time in council chambers on Wednesday before proclaiming Nov. 20 as the Trans Day of Remembrance.
> 
> “Thick as thieves they were,” Robin said, recounting how the two friends used to bond over plates of chicken fingers or wings.
> 
> “He came from a rough home, and my son told me he had a different name, a girl’s name. I said, ‘Oh. Whatever, dude, have a chicken wing,’ because in my house, everybody is safe.
> 
> “When he killed himself last year, it killed our family. This beautiful, loving kid. My wife, daughters and son were devastated by it.”
> 
> Douglas, whose obituary uses the pronoun ‘her,’ ended her life by shooting herself with her father’s handgun, due to bullying by peers, Robin said.
> 
> Robin said the teen came from a broken home.
> 
> “He found that a safe place was at my house with my son, because we treated everybody with respect, and that’s what I encourage everyone to do: treat people with respect regardless of where they’re at.
> 
> “When you’re an ally, you’re an ally, and that sometimes means speaking up, when others can’t,” said Robin, who has a sibling who is transitioning and another who is proudly gay.
> 
> “This is an opportunity where there are people who need to speak but they’re afraid to speak. I’m happy to speak for them,” Robin said.
> 
> The incident is a stark illustration of why the Trans Day of Remembrance is marked across the country and internationally.
> 
> Each year, Transgender Awareness Week Nov. 13-19 leads up to the Transgender Day of Remembrance observed on Nov. 20.
> 
> The day was founded in 1999 by Gwendolyn Ann Smith in memory of Rita Hester, a transgender woman from Boston who was murdered in 1998.
> 
> It is a day dedicated to honouring those who have lost their lives to transphobic violence and to reaffirm the need for inclusive spaces.
> 
> Based on 2018 self reporting statistics, transgender and gender diverse people in Canada were more likely than cisgender people to having been physically or sexually assaulted at least once since the age of 15, according to the government of Canada.
> 
> About a dozen members of the 2SLGBTQI+ community in Timmins and their allies gathered in council chambers for the proclamation on Wednesday.
> 
> The acronym stands for two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex. The ‘+’ symbolizes other marginalized identities connected to gender and sexual orientation.
> 
> Sam Kloetstra from Mattagami First Nation spoke of how being two-spirit is a timeless concept.
> 
> The Anishinaabe spirit Nanabozho is a sort of trickster or Jesus figure that can take either masculine or feminine form, he said. It is a worldview reflected in the Anishinaabe language.
> 
> “Our genders are animate and inanimate—things with spirit and things without spirit,” said Kloestra who works as in the child and youth wellbeing department in Mattagami.
> 
> “The idea that a spirit has gender associated with parts of their body is something that is entirely new to this land….we’ve always had the ability here to feel comfortable in our bodies, minds and spirits.”
> 
> Kloestra’s message for Trans Day of Remembrance, is to recall that Kaleisha (Clay) Douglas was deserving of love and a fulfilling life, like any child.
> 
> “Everyone knows someone who’s queer, it’s whether or not they feel comfortable telling you who they truly are. Meet anybody in your life with patience, love and empathy,” he said.
> 
> Kris Guay with Fierté Timmins Pride works as an underground miner and lived 24 years as a woman. He shared that having allies and a chosen family helped him embrace his true identity.
> 
> “Coming out as trans to my whole crew as mostly men had its own set of struggles. Between old-school mentality and lack of respect it really lit a fire underneath the fight for not only myself, but the other trans nonbinary folk who will follow after me,” Guay said.
> 
> “We need to lean on each other and advocate for those who cannot.”
