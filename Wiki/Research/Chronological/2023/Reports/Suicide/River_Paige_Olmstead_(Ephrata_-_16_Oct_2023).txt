> The book of River Paige Olmsted’s life began in Matthews, North Carolina in February 2006. Born to John A. and Molly S. (Holgate) Olmsted, River would soon become the middle child, and share many memories with siblings Noelle, and Helen Olmsted. The final chapter tragically ended on October 16, 2023.
> 
> The adventures in between were shared with many in Lancaster Mennonite Schools, Lancaster Catholic Schools, and Manheim Township High School. An active member at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church, River quickly learned they had a love for children and began volunteering with the Sunday School. River aspired to be a music therapist for children and volunteered for Lydia’s Closet. From an early age, they developed a love for music, and was apt to numerous musical instruments and singing. Music was everything!
> 
> River found peace being outdoors, especially when camping. As a skilled writer and poet, their muse was frequently found in animals. They also enjoyed working at the Renaissance Faire and would revel in the costumes and adornments. River was an avid reader and could frequently be found immersed in the pages of countless books.
> 
> River will be missed by all, especially her parents, siblings; aunts Heidi and Elizabeth; cousins, Catherine, Josephine, and William; 2 cats as well as 2 dogs, and countless friends
> 
> While their story ended far too soon, those who knew and loved them, are invited to Celebrate River’s Life and share of their tales together at 4 PM on Saturday, October 21, 2023, at St. Peter’s Lutheran Church, 10 Delp Road, Lancaster, PA 17601. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions are encouraged to be sent to Music for Everyone, musicforeveryone.org
