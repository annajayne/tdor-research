suicide



> We've got reports of two trans youths who were lost to suicide this year, Molly, 14, and Kalle, 14. It's reported in the articles that the cause of Molly's despair was being stuck in a queue waiting for her first contact at a trans healthcare clinic. Kalle was placed into a compulsory care home for troubled girls in spite of insisting on being treated as the young man he was, and was routinely placed in isolation for unclear reasons, where he took his life.

> 14-year-old Molly took her own life - stood in the care queue for over a year
> Published 2023-08-19
> 
> Molly was born a boy, but already in elementary school she started to feel like a girl.
> 
> For over 1.5 years she stood in line to receive care. But in the end she couldn't take it anymore.
> 
> - She had panic before puberty, it was like a ticking bomb in front of her, says her mother.
> 
> Trans care was delayed - Molly took her own life
> It was in May this year that 14-year-old Molly left home and never came back.
> 
> An eyewitness has told her parents, Anneli and Angelito, how a little girl took off her helmet and left behind her white electric scooter before taking her own life.
> 
> Molly was born a boy, but already at the age of ten she started to feel like a girl. The family sought help but had to wait over 1.5 years in the care queue. Finally, Molly couldn't wait any longer.
> 
> "Happy and driven"
> Pictures of Molly hang on the walls of the summer house in Stockholm. This is where she used to spend the summers with her three siblings.
> 
> Bathe, play computer games and drive quad bikes.
> 
> - She was social, resourceful, happy and very driven. What she wanted to get through, she solved somehow, says her mother Anneli.
> 
> Together with her grandfather, Molly built a coffee cart. She used to often go out to sell coffee and buns in the neighborhood. At the parties, she always acted as a waitress and had various singing performances. She had big dreams for the future.
> 
> - She wanted to be many different things. Pilot, policeman and brain surgeon. The last time she said "mother, I want to save lives", says Anneli.
> 
> "We tried to support her and give her hope.  You never believe that your child will take her own life, even if she says so," says Angelito.

> "She cried herself to sleep every night"
> During the summer break between third and fourth grade, Molly began to feel unwell. She withdrew and was not as eager to spend time with her family anymore.
> 
> - She cried herself to sleep every night. We didn't understand why, says Angelito.
> 
> After the summer, she started fourth grade. But Molly still felt just as bad. She got into conflicts with her classmates and began to dislike school.
> 
> - She got a full-time resource in the class, but nothing worked. It was really hard. We didn't understand anything, says Anneli.
> 
> It would take another year before Anneli and Angelito finally found out what was behind Molly's deteriorating condition. Molly told the school counselor that she actually feels like a girl. She asked him to tell her parents.
> 
> - We were happy to have finally found out why she was unwell. We supported her and said she was very brave who dared to tell, says Anneli.
> 
> At first, the family thought it was a phase, that she would change after a while. But a few months later, when Molly bought girls' clothes and chose her new name "Molly", the parents understood that this was real.
> 
> Was in the queue for BUP
> In the spring of 2021, Molly started having suicidal thoughts. The family sought care and had to join the queue for child and youth psychiatry, BUP.
> 
> - You are completely powerless. You stand in a queue and can't do anything. You can't even find out which place in the queue you have, says Anneli.
> 
> Almost six months later, Molly finally got an appointment.
> 
> - We had to meet with a counselor, but she judged that Molly did not need to have contact. That she was not quite ready for it and that the conversations would make her feel worse, she says.
> 
> Molly still had to see the counselor a few times before she would receive a referral to BUP Gender incongruence and gender dysphoria, KID. But the referral was missed and not sent until three months later.
> 
> - The curator apologized a thousand times, but Molly couldn't really buy it. She was very sad about it, says Anneli.
> 
> In February 2022, Molly was put in the queue for KID. 15 months later, on May 30, 2023, she would have her first visit there.
> 
> - It was a very busy time, Molly was very down. She was just down in the basement, taping all the windows because she didn't want light in and so no one would see her. She didn't want to go to school and lost contact with her friends, says Anneli.
> 
> - She often said that she did not want to live. She wondered if you could go abroad to get euthanasia or just cut off your dick. We tried to support her and give her hope. You never believe that your child will take her own life, even if she says so, says Angelito.
> 
> Different care contacts
> During the time Molly was in the queue for KID, she had various care contacts. She had conversations with a psychologist at the health center, one at the Children and Youth Center (BUMM) and conversations with the counselor at school.
> 
> But after her first suicide attempt, the family was referred to BUP. She was transferred there and all care contact would be coordinated through them.
> 
> - The psychologist at the health center panicked and said that this is completely the wrong level of care, says Anneli.
> 
> Three months later, she got an appointment at BUP. She was prescribed antidepressants. The treatment was followed up by a telephone call and a visit with a nurse at BUP.
> 
> - We strongly requested a doctor's visit and she had no talk therapy due to a lack of therapists. Instead, we had to do an online course about anxiety and depression, says Anneli.
> 
> After a suicide attempt in early May, the family called for a suicide assessment. Molly was called in by BUP for an assessment, but it was already too late.
> 
> On May 10, Molly turned 14. But just two weeks later she ended her life – she never made it to KID.
> 
> - She didn't want to get older. She didn't want to develop into a boy. That was what everything revolved around. She felt bad when she changed, when she showered. Every time she saw the body she didn't want, her mother says.
> 
> "She was social, resourceful, happy and very driven. What she wanted to get through, she solved somehow," says Molly's mother Anneli.

> Long waiting times
> The waiting times for BUP Gender incongruence and gender dysphoria are 16–18 months. Göran Rydén is director of operations at BUP Stockholm and says that they are aware that the wait for care is long.
> 
> - Precisely gender incongruence and gender dysphoria require a very specialized competence that not many people in healthcare have. It is also important to do these investigations carefully. At the same time, we have seen an increase in the number of applicants in recent years, and this overall contributes to longer waiting times than for other care, he says.
> 
> According to Rydén, work is underway in Stockholm and in several other parts of the country to expand what is called the first line, which is at the health center. The purpose of it is to be able to detect and treat mild and moderate mental illness in children and young people.
> 
> Molly had to wait in line for over a year, is that a reasonable waiting time?
> 
> - Of course, I cannot comment on the individual case. In general, I can say that we always provide care to the most seriously ill first. Often it is about other difficulties than the gender dysphoria itself that require treatment efforts. This means that treatment is given at another of our receptions while waiting for the child to have time for the more specific investigation.
> 
> What problems do you see with child psychiatry?
> 
> - A problem that we see is that there is an expectation in society that child psychiatry should deal with all mental illness in children and young people. At the same time, child and youth psychiatry is a very specialized activity and many of the problems we face are about the school situation or about milder problems that should be taken care of at the health center, says Rydén.
