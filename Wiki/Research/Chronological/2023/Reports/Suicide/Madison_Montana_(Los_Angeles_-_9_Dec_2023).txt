> My best friend, Madison Montana, passed away from suicide on December 9th, 2023 at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. They were just 26 years old. I didn't find their page.
> 
> They're a wonderful musician and artist. You'd usually always see them with their ukulele, Mercy, singing and playing in nature. Their art was used to not only process their ongoing trauma and emotions, but they also used their art for advocacy and social justice.
> 
> Madison also loves video games and grew up with Nintendo stuff! They could play through the Donkey Kong Trilogy effortlessly and also help you become addicted to Kirby.
> 
> They're nonbinary, bisexual, and a furry. There's much more to say about them, but they're the most emotionally compassionate and empathetic person I know. They're also quite goofy.
