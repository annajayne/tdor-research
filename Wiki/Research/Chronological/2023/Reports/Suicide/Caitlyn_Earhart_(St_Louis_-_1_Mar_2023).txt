I've just learned of a 19 year old trans woman by the name of Caitlyn Éowyn Earhart ("Cait") who died by suicide in St Louis, MO on 1 Mar 2023.

I can't find much, but I think her profile is https://www.facebook.com/lchBinKeinMann.

It's been wiped clean by an unaccepting family but I did manage to find what might be her obiturary (albeit in her deadname, so it doesn't add much other than her birthdate.

As the profile has been effectively wiped I can't find much else, but based on activity she seems to have been into Marvel and Lord of the Rings.

This might be her:

> 21 days ago, I lost a friend. A sister. An intelligent, graceful being who graced this Earth, but the world was so unkind to her. May Cait Éowyn Earhart rest in peace. (2003-2023)
> If you're ever struggling with mental health, there are resources out there:

> It's a scary time to be a Trans Woman in this era. But we must look out for each other and hold our heads high. Be there for one another so a tragedy like this may not happen again.
> I'll miss your soft voice, your positive outlook at the world. You always said, "Today is the greatest day of my life." I'll carry your soul with the rest of my life.

Based on her middle name and the contents of this post - https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=515451106912102&set=a.515457736911439 - I'd say she came out in April 2022.
