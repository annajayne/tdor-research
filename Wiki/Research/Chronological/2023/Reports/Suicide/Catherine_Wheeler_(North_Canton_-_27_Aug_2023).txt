> Hello,
> 
> One of my previous neighbors died by suicide this past weekend. Here is her obituary: https://www.beaconjournal.com/obituaries/pwoo0559023
> 
> When I was a kid, Catherine's family were my backyard neighbors. My older sister was best friend with Catherine's sister Deanna. Catherine was much older than me so I didn't really interact a ton with her as a kid, but I remember her really enjoying computers. I also remember her parents would hold New Year's Eve parties every year and at midnight we would all dance around the house. She publicly transitioned many years after my family moved so I didn't actually get to meet her as her full self. And even though I didn't really get to know her, it pains me to have occasion to report this. I read the TDOR list every year and I wish I did not have someone to add.
> 
> In regards to knowing how she passed since it is not mentioned in the obituary, my parents still occasionally talk with Catherine's parents. My mother informed me and my sisters yesterday.




> Catherine Wheeler died peacefully on August 27, 2023 in North Canton, Ohio. She was born on January 10, 1988 to Barbara (Kutz) and Douglas Wheeler in Canton, Ohio. She graduated from Green High School and Kent State University.
> 
> Catherine was preceded in death by grandparents Gloria and Robert Wheeler and uncle Steve Wheeler.
> 
> In addition to her parents, Catherine is survived by sister Deanna Wheeler Bennett and her husband Kevin Bennett of Columbus, grandparents Mary and John Kutz, aunts and uncles Susan Elcock, Sue Wheeler, Jeff Kutz, and Brian (Monica) Kutz, partner Emily Joy Davis and numerous cousins.
> 
> A private memorial will be held at a later date. To honor Catherine, please consider donating to the Gay Community Endowment Fund of Akron at www.akroncf.org/give/GCEF in her memory. Peace. You may sign the tribute page at: arnoldfuneralhome.com
