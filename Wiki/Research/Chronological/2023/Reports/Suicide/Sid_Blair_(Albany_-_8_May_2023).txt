I know that it's already too late for them to be included in any 2023 vigils, but a close friend of mine, Sid Blair, died by suicide on May 8th, 2023. They were nonbinary, self described as a butch lesbian, and used they/them pronouns. I'm not sure what location to pin down for them, as they went to college with me in Bennington VT, before passing away in a hospital in Albany, and then being taken to their home state of Oklahoma and buried under their dead name. I'd rather use that name as little as possible, but if you're looking for the atrocious obituary their family wrote, it's under Sierra Johnson. They were born on January 14th, 2004. I'm currently submitting this via the website, but if you want me to send any more pictures or information about them, feel free to contact me at [redacted] and I'll send along what I can. Like I said, I know it's probably too late for them to be included in any official listings, but I still figured that something is better than nothing. I owe them that much at least.
