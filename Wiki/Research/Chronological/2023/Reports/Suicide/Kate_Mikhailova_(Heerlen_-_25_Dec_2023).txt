> Asylum seeker Kate Mikhailova, who fled Moldova, has died. The 21-year-old trans woman took her own life on Christmas Day. LGBT Asylum Support has announced this.
> 
> Her asylum application was rejected last week. Kate fled her country because of the transphobic climate. She ended up in the asylum center in Heerlen, where she again faced threats and discrimination.
> 
> 
> Kate Mikhailova did not feel safe in the Netherlands and did not receive the protection she needed to be herself. She is the fourth asylum seeker to take her own life this year. LGBT Asylum Support is very concerned about the increase in the number of suicides among LGBTI-plus asylum seekers.
