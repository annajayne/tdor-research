> Hello,
> 
> This is only the photo I have of her. He didn't post his face often, but I managed to find this. 
> 
> Regarding quotes, I was wondering if I could include a quote from some of their poetry? I want her writing to be remembered somewhere, because he talked to me sometimes about wanting to become an author professionally.
> 
> This is just a short but poignant poem I found from him I'd like to include:
> "There are stars on my bedroom ceiling, and I dream of becoming a constellation after I die."
> 
> We'd talk often about our stories or characters or any other aspect of our writing for hours on end, and he was very fond of creating fantasy stories with magic and robots and queer expression. I got her into the band Steam Powered Giraffe, and we talked about them and their music often too. Other than that, I just want to make sure she's remembered as a fiercely creative and intelligent writer and person, whose queerness won't be erased by their homophobic and transphobic country or family.
> 
> Thank you so much.


> Enquiry via https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/pages/contact from: [redacted]
> 
> My friend, Akshaj (z"l), recently committed suicide and I want to add her name to here, because I know his government will never deem her death related to specifically trans mental health issues. He died Tuesday December 5th, 2023. They liked writing poetry and stories, especially in fantasy settings. I met her online during the pandemic, and I think I helped him realize he was queer and nonbinary by talking with them so often. We talked so much, about our stories and lives, and she will be missed greatly certainly by me and his other writer friends. I'll add two links to different articles about her. They only use he/him pronouns for them, but he uses any pronouns. 
>> 
>> I was unfortunately too late when I saw some disturbing things on his tumblr account, talking about how they were scared to grow up and become an adult. I can't say for certain she killed herself because of dysphoria or transphobia in her home country of India, but they were still a trans friend of mine taken too soon. Thank you.
