> In April of this year, my best friend Lucy took her own life after a life of struggle after struggle. She was a trans-feminine 16 year old who identified as both a trans woman and non-binary individual.
> 
> She suffered from bullying and harassment over her identity and I woke up on the 21st of April to the police at my door - they informed me of her death the day prior.
> 
> Despite her trying her best, her struggles got too big for haer to manage. She had been thinking about her future, and hoped to go into cyber security. She will never have that chance.
> 
> This year would've been her last one of secondary school here in Scotland. Although she was open about her identity with all of her friends, her parents hadn't quite managed to wrap their heads around it yet and so she wasn't able to be herself in death. Her funeral video, which is up on YouTube, is a constant reminder of the ignorance surrounding her identity. I don't want Lucy's legacy to be one of a boy who never existed. She was a confident and headstrong young woman who knew herself in and out and who then got to know me in and out. I feel her loss keenly each and every day.
