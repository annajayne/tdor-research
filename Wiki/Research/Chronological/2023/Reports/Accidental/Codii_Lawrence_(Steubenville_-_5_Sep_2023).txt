> The epidemic of anti-trans violence struck close to home with the reported death of 25 year old Dacoda ‘Codii’ Lawrence of Steubenville, Ohio on September 5, 2023 at 3:30 AM. Steubenville is about 40 miles from Pittsburgh. Codii died in nearby Weirton, Brooke County, West Virginia.
> 
> The Brooke County Sheriff’s Office said a person was walking on U.S. 22 on Main Street at the Harmon Creek exit when they was struck by a vehicle.Codii was purportedly dressed mainly in dark clothing, and a call had been made to the emergency 911 center prior to the accident by a driver concerned about him..
> 
> The driver remained at the scene and was cooperating with the accident’s investigation.
> 
> Local law enforcement say vehicles travel at a high rate of speed there and noted that Codii was dressed in dark clothing. Visibility and speed create what’s described as “a terrible area up there.”
> 
> So why was a 25 year old resident of Steubenville walking along this terrible road at 3:30 in the morning 30 miles from home? There are some whisperings that Codii was not alone, but with a group of 3-5 other people. I don’t know why they didn’t remain on the scene or perhaps they did and the police simply did not note it. Anything is possible.
> 
> It is our obligation to ask questions, to ensure everything is aboveboard, and that loose ends are addressed.
> 
> Codii lived and died just outside of Pittsburgh. I’ve driven that stretch of highway many times. I reached out to his friends to ask if they’d like #ProtectTransKids signs and stickers.
> 
> Born in Port Huron, Michigan, Codii great up with three siblings and his parents. The family relocated to Winterville, Ohio. He graduated from Indian Creek High School and most recently worked as a cook at a Steubenville restaurant. Codii had multiple social media accounts filled with the typical content of a 20something young adult – music, tv shows, books, and games he enjoyed. And his friends.
> 
> What’s most evident is how fiercely Codii’s friends loved him. That emanates from every post, every comment, and more. They are protective of his memory and legacy now, but scrolling back through his public content shows just how deep those ties were forged. Friends recently gathered to pay tribute to Codii.

> the most genuine amazing human being your smile was contagious
> 
> You were definitely family and like a brother to me. The most genuine and caring person I have ever met.
> 
> You always Showed me respect I love you I
> 
> we all love you to the moon & back baby, you deserved nothing less than the best
> 
> the most genuine amazing human being your smile was contagious
> 
> bro you make everything easier bro and you always got my back so that’s why I ride for you the way I do
> 
> There will be no services at this time and burial will be at the convenience of the family. Sadly the obituary and mainstream media references use Codii’s government name and misgender him.
> 
> Codii’s death is the 23rd reported in 2023 to date. He is the fifth white person and the fourth trans masculine victim. At age 25, Codii falls in the median age range of victims. Codii’s death happened on the same date as two other known victims this year, a sad and disturbing confluence.
> 
> Rest in power, Codii. Your light was bright and touched many people. You deserved a safer world with years of opportunities and experiences. I hope we can find that world for you and others. Thank you for all that you brought to this world.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
