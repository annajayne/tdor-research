> On October 8th, Brooke was driving when she ran out of gas. She exited her car, we can only assume, to get to a gas station. Unfortunately, Brooke was hit by another car. She did not survive the accident. Brooke was only 23 years old.
> 
> As expected, the family did not plan for such a terrible event and are struggling through economic hardship as it is. I am asking for donations to help with the costs and burden of laying their child to rest.
> 
> Please help support them in their time of grieving. Thank you, and may God bless you.
