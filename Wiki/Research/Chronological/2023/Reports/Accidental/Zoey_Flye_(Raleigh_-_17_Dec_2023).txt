Zoey worked for Amazon delivering packages; please thank your Amazon drivers with treats whenever possible as it rapidly became apparent how brutally taxing the job can be. She enjoyed a trip to Japan with high school friends earlier this year and returned with a new sense of appreciation for different cultures.
