Tyler Svetich, 22, was found dead in the Jordan River. Eighteen-year-old Tree Crane, of South Jordan, died by suicide, according to his flag’s placard. The fourth person, a 61-year-old trans woman, is being remembered anonymously because according to the place card, she was not out to her profession.
