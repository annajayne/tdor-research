> September 19, 2023
> 
> This Tuesday, the San Juan Justice decided to charge with aggravated manslaughter the couple who owns a property where three trans girls died on August 12 due to carbon monoxide inhalation.
> 
> They are José Oscar Muñoz and his wife Teresa Scalise, who are owners of the property that they rented to the three deceased. They were this day in front of Judge Alberto Ramón Caballero at the formalization hearing. It was there that the Justice Department granted prosecutor Grassi and the defense five months of preparatory criminal investigation.
> 
> The experts indicated that in the apartment that Muñoz and Scalise rented there were at least three pieces of equipment that ran on gas and did not have the corresponding security measures. These are a kitchen, a heater and a water heater that did not have escape routes to evacuate the remains of the combustion.
> 
> The accused couple are complicated by the expertise of Ecogas, but also by a municipal report that indicates that the property was not authorized to be used as accommodation for people.
> 
> It was on August 12 when three girls identified as Sasha Dubois, Yeni Narváez and Tiziana Salinas were found dead around four in the morning.
> 
> They all died after inhaling carbon monoxide. The prosecutors determined that both the stove and the heater were working, but these three young women lost consciousness due to this inhalation, since the autopsies determined that they had no injuries or signs of violence.
> 
> According to what was reported by the Fire Department, the property had no ventilation, no kitchen chimney outlet, nor visible windows, since it was a garage that was converted into an apartment. It was rented by these young women.
