> Barbie Di Rocco BREAKED IN CRY over the DEATH of Vanessa Show and TARGETED against Alberto Ferriols
> The death of Vanessa Show at the age of 77 , the first trans star in Argentina and a pioneer for the transsexual collective in our country , left an enigma. The ex-panelist of Bendita had recently had her lolas operated on with Alberto Ferriols , surgeon and ex-husband of Beatriz Salomón, and according to actress Barbie Di Rocco , after her intervention the artist's health was in decline.
> 
> “I don't stand up for Ferriols. When she had her lolas operated on she told me 'bring her to Vanesa for the check-ups'. It was his responsibility as a doctor.”
> 
> The figure of Sex visited Partners of the show and was moved to tears when remembering their friendship. “I have the audios and videos… She told me something that killed me. She gave me a dress and told me 'try this dress, I see myself in you'. That a smaller transvestite feels that her role model is reflected in her killed me,'” she said honestly, through tears.
> 
> Heartbroken, she pointed out the mistreatment that Vanessa received in her last days. “There is nothing advanced, like the fact that the clinic treats her as a male. A nurse told me 'I bathed him, I tidied him up' and I didn't want to say anything because when it's like that, they might end up treating her worse. “She was alone in that clinic,” she lamented.
> 
> The legendary star, according to what they said, had fallen, so she had to have her breast prostheses changed by the renowned surgeon. “Alberto Ferriols operates in that clinic, where I had surgery a few years ago, and I asked him to have someone watch it because I didn't feel confident. I am convinced that she should not have died. It was obvious that he was in bad shape,” she said.
> 
> “Do you think that what happened to her has to do with the operation they did?” Mariana Brey asked Barbie. “It may have weakened her a little. She always told me that the pandemic had ruined her a lot, being older. The last thing she told me was that she wanted to go to her house with her cat and 'I want to walk out of here.' And it wasn't like that,” she recalled.
> 
> “I am convinced that she should not have died. It was clear that she was in bad shape.”
> 
> “Ferriols told me that he had sedated her because she had wanted to remove a catheter. His assistant was at the clinic, but I don't support Ferriols. When she had her lolas operated on she told me 'bring her to Vanesa for the check-ups'. It was his responsibility as a doctor,” she noted.
