> 
> Gabriel was known in many communities, involved in many ways. His passion, enthusiasm, and whacky humor were the characteristics that were the core of his being. Recently employed full-time by Deerfoot City Canadian Tire, his love and dedication to what he did, and whom he did it with were prevalent in every way. His love for diversity, inclusion, and equality, was a long-time path of advocacy for him. As a member of the Calgary Drag Community, he will be remembered as a “Slay Qween” and a bright light on stage. His Family and Friends knew that Gabriel’s life was never a dull moment, and everything he did, he did with class, style, passion and integrity. He will be dearly, greatly and incredibly missed by all who knew him, which were many. His love for his Siblings, Mother, Relatives, Friends, and his “Polar Prince” Brady, were always mentioned by Gabe.
