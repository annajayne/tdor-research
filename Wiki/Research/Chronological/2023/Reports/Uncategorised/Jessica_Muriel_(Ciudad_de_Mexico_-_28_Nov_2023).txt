> Who was Jessica Muriel?
> Originally from Tijuana, Baja California, Jessica Muriel moved her talent and aspirations to the then Federal District, today Mexico City. Upon arriving in the country's capital, she realized that LGBT issues were treated with suspicion and prejudice, something that did not prevent her from succeeding.
> 
> Initially hired in the capital, she soon stood out, even earning the nickname The Wonder of the Century from the press. This nickname was given to her due to her bravery in making visible and paving the way for the trans community in a historically conservative context. Admired in artistic settings, she embraced lyrical singing and dance, including styles such as jazz.
> 
> The curiosity of the media and the public was immediate, showing a special interest in their gender identity. 
> 
> This attention often led to invasive questions about his personal life and his transition decisions.
> 
> Her journey has also included complex personal experiences, such as estrangement from her son, who was 16 years old at the time the two parties went their separate ways.
> 
> Her story reflects the complexity of the human experience, mixing art, activism and personal struggles.
