> Good morning  to those planning to attend the service  for my baby Monday 1:30 family hour 2 pm service at Lawrence E moons funeral home all are welcome . If you can wear a pop of red please do that's her favorite color and if not please come as you are . I know we are all grieving  and taking this hard and by all means CRY if you have to but let's try to keep this peaceful and respectful HONORING her in the same way she would do for yall with no anger towards anyone and no drama. This will be my last moments with my baby and I want it to be as beautiful  as I planned it to be . I can't control who walks through that door but my baby funeral  isn't the place to deal with it . I love the love you guys are giving and I appreciate all of the support. This is not a good bye but a see you later

> STORY TIME : I knew my baby was who she was at a very young age . I remember the daycare used to call me while I’m trying to work saying “ Jordan won’t dress up in the the fireman or police outfit , he wants the dress and heels “.  As a parent it was frustrating and I did what most parents would do , heck back then it wasn’t this open in society. I fussed everytime he did anything feminine , tried to hide Lauryn’s dolls, bought game systems he never touched , and tried to put every sports ball I could into his hands hoping it would take over what he was feeling and NOTHING worked . It had gotten to the point that the schools were calling because my baby would fight weekly and he would constantly be getting kicked out of school but he never told me he was getting bullied and taunted everyday so I did what every parent would do  spankings ,punishments you name it . Fast forward to age 14 - 16 you’re a single parent having to go to work leaving a teenager showing signs of severe depression in spite of being in church a lot and YEARS of counseling sessions not knowing if you were going to come to your baby hanging from a closet or laid out on the floor from taking pills .. THIS WAS OUR STORY . This was never a case of someone seeing things on TV or seeing Gay people out n public because it wasn’t like how it is now back then . It wasn’t until about 4 years ago Jordan decided to become who he really was and stop fighting the feelings he  felt his entire life and that was being Emoni Nicole at that very moment my baby FELT FREE . If you really knew the journey there is no need to question how I’m sending my baby out . I’m sending my baby out the way SHE fought so many years to be and that’s WHO SHE IS … EMONI HAS EARNED EVERY BIT OF IT. If this touched your heart or made you look At Transgender individuals a little bit differently please share because  if I can help one parent still find love in their heart for their baby or if can can prevent one person who is afraid to be who they are to not end their life because they can’t be themselves unapologetically MY JOB IS DONE . I give my baby 10’s ACROSS THE BOARD because when she said Screw the world  and their feelings she came out swinging and finally free
