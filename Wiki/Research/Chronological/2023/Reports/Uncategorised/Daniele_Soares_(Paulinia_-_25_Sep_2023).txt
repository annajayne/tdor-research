> The body of a nurse who worked at Unicamp, Daniele Soares, aged 46, was found in a wooded area this Monday (25) in the Morro Alto neighborhood, in Paulínia. She had been missing since Friday (22). The Civil Police investigates the case. Popularly, the woman was known as Dani.
> 
> As determined by the report with the GCM (Municipal Civil Guard), the hypothesis of murder has not been ruled out. Dany was a trans woman, and an activist for the LGBT cause. On social media, the death has generated a lot of commotion. "My dear friend left. How sad," said an internet user.
> 
> At the police station, the case was registered as a suspicious death. The woman's body was sent to the IML (Legal Medical Institute), so that the cause of death could be determined. Dani's wake will be held from 9am, at the Paulínia Municipal Velório, on Rua Salvador Lombardi Netto, 568, from 9am.
> 
> We asked the SSP (Public Security Secretariat) of the State of São Paulo for a position on the death, and are awaiting a response. The case is ongoing and we will soon bring more information about the incident. 
> 
> Coletivo Boca de Sissí issued the following note:
> 
> " It is with great regret that we, from the Boca de Sissí Art, Culture and Human Rights Collective, have come forward to announce the death of one of our members, Daniele Soares. At the age of 46, our dear "Dani", a nursing assistant, left  without to say goodbye, but what remains are the nostalgia and consideration for her life and struggle. A member of the collective since its foundation, Daniele shared her experience, exuded joy and inspired the struggle of many other generations. Rest easy, our companion. Your legacy will be forever ."
