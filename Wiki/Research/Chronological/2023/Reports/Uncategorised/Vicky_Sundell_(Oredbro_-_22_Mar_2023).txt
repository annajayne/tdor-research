> Hello again, another report, this one with information from a close one rather than a news article. Picture of Vicky attached.
> VICKY SUNDELL, 33 years old, born march 19 1990, died march 22 2023 in Örebro, Sweden.
> 
> Cause of death still unknown.
> 
> Text from Frida Börjesson, Vicky's chosen mom.

> Vicky was a lively girl with a good sense of humor and great intelligence who came to Sweden as a child and grew up in Örebro. I met Vicky in a trans group on Facebook, she was shunned by her parents and I was mourning my childlessness. I have always thought I would like to be a mom to one of these shunned trans children. So we decided pretty early on to become mom and daughter. We were going to do a legal adoption but she died before we could.
>
> Vicky was let down by the authorities, the healthcare system and the trans healthcare system in many ways. For example she was forcibly sterilized six months after the law on forced sterilization was repealed in 2013, because no one told her that she no longer had to be forcibly sterilized to be allowed to change her legal sex. When she later applied for compensation from the state, she was denied because she had obtained the approval to remove her gonads from the Judicial Council after the law had been changed. Nobody had informed her that the law had changed and she was never offered to freeze and gametes. Vicky would have wanted the option to have children and suffered a lot because of this.
> Her chosen dad was the one who told me Vicky was no longer with us. I screamed out loud, felt like my heart was literally breaking into pieces. 
> Since then it's been a fight to find out why she died and to understand what happened. Her bio family had the legal right to bury her and did so under her deadname and as a male, even though Vicky had changed both her name and sex legally. I've requested the autopsy report from the coroner's office but as I am not legally related, they blacked out all the parts explaining how she died.
> I want to give Vicky justice, but I don't know how.
> Things were hopeful and looking bright right before she died so I don't think it was suicide, but now knowing is hard. Sometimes in the mornings, I say "Vicky my beloved daughter, come and haunt me."
> We've had a memorial service for you Vicky and you are always in my heart as my daughter. Vicky, sometimes you thought you didn't have that many friends, but at your memories there were so many people who you meant so much to. You were loved by many and you spread your love around you. Thank you for you. I will keep fighting.
> I love you.


> Today marks three weeks since you left us. My beloved daughter, you were betrayed by both addiction care and trans care. I wish I could do more for you. Always want to remember our moments of joy, our difficult moments and even our arguments because through it all your love, your humor and your vulnerability shone. Your light will always shine in my heart, forever loved Vicky . ❤
