> Zoey Hernandez (Zae), age 24, of Frisco, Texas passed away on Tuesday, September 5, 2023.
> 
> We mourn the loss of our beautiful Zoey and celebrate the journey of her life. Zoey was determined, from a very young age, to live the life she knew she wanted and be the girl she always knew she was. It wasn’t an easy path to get there, but that didn’t stop her from accomplishing everything she wanted by the age of 24. Her true journey was only beginning, heartbreaking it was cut so short.
> 
> Zoey had a huge heart and was very thoughtful in her wishes for others. She always put so much thought into her gifts for others, Christmas present shopping was one of her favorite times of year. Zoey was an entrepreneur from a very young age, she loved money. Whether it was a lemonade stand, jewelry stand, or selling shoes in the family business, she was determined to make money. Zoey would even hire her brothers and neighborhood kids to work for her, very little pay I must say. Zoey loved the holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas were her favorite times of year. She loved the time with family, but she also loved the FOOD. She always made sure that we were having her favorites, and that she was first in line.
> 
> Zoey loved life; she loved her life. Her confidence could fill a room, her laugh was contagious and will be missed around the house so much. She had big dreams, and nothing was out of reach in her mind. Everything she said she was going to do, she did. She lived her best life every day, despite all the setbacks and challenges she faced along the way. Nothing stopped Zoey from accomplishing her goals! Zoey worshiped her mom, and that bond was like no other. Her love for family and friends was so strong, words cannot express how much she will be missed by all that were lucky enough to know her.
