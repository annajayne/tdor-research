> Friends of the Bronx, New York, resident had posted on Instagram that Blackwell was missing earlier this week.
> 
> Shortly before midnight on Saturday evening, NYPD officers responded to a call for a person needing medical assistance in the vicinity of Seventh Avenue and West 42nd Street. That location, in the heart of Times Square, is a heavily trafficked area 24/7 with more than 85,000 people passing through nightly between 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. “Upon arrival, officers observed an unconscious adult male on the northbound [2 line] subway tracks,” a NYPD spokesman said Wednesday. “EMS responded to the location and pronounced him dead at the scene.”
> 
> The cause of Blackwell’s death has not been determined and the investigation remains ongoing, according to the NYPD spokesperson.
> 
> The New York City office of the chief medical examiner’s assistant director of forensic biology Mark Desire said Blackwell’s case is pending. The brown-eyed model, who was 5 feet, 10 inches with a face tattoo of a Chinese symbol, was said to have worked for fashion designers Shayne Oliver and Telfar Clemens. Representatives from both companies did not respond immediately to media requests Wednesday.
> 
> On Instagram, @TommyPlayboy described themselves as “Misunderstood Misfit. Model. Movement Artist. Youth Advocate.” Blackwell was said to have danced in Thalía’s music video “La Luz” and aspired to model for Balenciaga. Wearing a Donatella Versace-like blonde wig, sunglasses and a glimmering black evening dress, the model attended last week’s dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Temple of Dendur in honor of its yearlong partnership with the Korean beauty brand Sulwhasoo. They had thanked PR Consulting on social media for the invitation.

> 
> Love said that by "showing up in her fullness and queerness," Blackwell provided "an intersectional conversation to that experience," along with light and laughter.
> 
> Blackwell's friend hopes the community will remember her as the nation faces an ongoing culture war and "things that don't allow us to have peace and serenity."
> 
> "We can't keep being to constantly traumatized as we're trying to navigate the difficult world that we live in, because it's difficult for everyone," Love said.
> 
> "We, in the spirit of a person like Tommy, keep going, and keep transforming," Love said. "We — and they — deserve a space to also be and feel loved."
