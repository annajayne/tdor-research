> "On December 01, 2023, the owner of the property where Eva lived, had approached to collect the rent, but had not found her. Because he was not responding to messages or calls, on December 07, 2023, he approached the apartment finding the door ajar (without having been forced), what he enters perceives characteristic odors of decomposing elements, so he did not enter and left. He returned to the scene now with his wife and with a phone so that he could record and there is evidence; Eva was found in her bed in a state of decomposition in the supine position."

> 
> Eva (Names protected by Runa Sipiy SX-CUE-2671223), 28 years old, was found dead in her apartment in the province of Azuay, Ecuador. It is feared that it was a violent death. On December 1, 2023, the owner of the property where Eva lived had come to collect her rent, but had not found her rent. Because he did not respond to messages or calls, on December 7, 2023, he approached the apartment finding the door open (without having been forced), upon entering he perceived characteristic odors of decomposing elements, so he did not enter and he retired. She returned to the scene now with his wife and with a phone so she could record it and have evidence; Eva was found in her bed in a state of decomposition in a supine position . The relatives, as we know, have made all kinds of excuses for not taking care of her body, which is why they still remain in the morgue. Eva's body has not yet had a proper autopsy performed, because they require data that only her relatives could provide, since sometimes they recognize her and other times they do not.
> 
> For what has been described, we call on the State Attorney General, Diana Salazar, and the General Commander of Police, GraD. César Zapata, to the Minister of the Ministry of Women and Human Rights, Arianna Tanca, to the Undersecretary of Diversities ratified in the government of Daniel Noboa, Alexander Guano, to the Ombudsman of Ecuador (e), Cesar Córdoba Valverde, to carry out the necessary coordination to find the culprit(s) of this fact that mourns our community.
> 
> The Runa Sipiy Report of the Silueta
> 
> We even call attention to the Undersecretary of Diversities ratified in the government of Daniel Noboa and Minister Arianna Tanca, Alexander Guano, since they have requested information on cases from their team and we have delivered it to them in a timely manner, including some with more four months in advance. In fact, we have requested information since October 25, 2023 (CIUDADANO-CIU-2023-48815 No.), about the data that we have provided, without having received a response to date.
> 
> NOTE: To request information about this case, due to the aforementioned background, it must be done through a formal letter with a responsibility signature to silhouettex@gmail.com or through the citizen user Diane Marie Rodríguez Zambrano with CI 092199948-8. This is so that our territorial work is not made invisible as is customary in the previous administration and what we hope does not continue to happen with the administration of the current minister, Ariana Tanca and the confirmed undersecretary of diversities, Alexander Guano.
