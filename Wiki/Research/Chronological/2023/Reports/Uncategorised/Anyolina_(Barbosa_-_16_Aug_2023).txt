> According to the authorities, the body of the 33-year-old trans woman, known as Anyolina Acevedo Rendón, was found near the Montañita village, Cinco Riales sector, in the northern municipality of Aburrá.
> 
> According to the information available, the woman had left her house located in the El Porvenir de Barbosa neighborhood at around 5:30 am , indicating that she was going to go swimming in a nearby ravine.
> 
> However, days later she was found dead at that point, almost 4 kilometers from the last place where she was seen alive. Apparently, the current of the water would have caused her to drown.
> 
> As it turned out, the trans woman had suffered a severe blow to the head days ago that would have caused a concussion that made her act illogically in some situations.
> 
> After the recovery of the body by the experts of the Prosecutor's Office, Anyolina's family is asking for the collaboration of the community to pay for her funeral expenses since she is a family with limited resources.


> This Wednesday, August 16, the lifeless body of a woman was found on the banks of a Barbosa ravine.
>

> 
> According to the information 'Anyolina', as the victim was called, left her house located in the somewhat out-of-the-way neighborhood of Porvenir early Monday morning, around 5:30 in the morning, and acquaintances mention that she said she was going to go to swim, but since she knew how to face these waters, no one thought she was going to drown.
> 
> In fact, they would be looking for her in other areas of the city. However, she would have drowned since that same Monday morning and she was dragged by the current of the ravine to Barbosa .
> 
> The lifeless body of 'Anyolina' was found by an inhabitant of the sector and firefighters came to the place to rescue the body.
