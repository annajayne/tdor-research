> Autistic trans teen starves to death
> A 17 year old autistic trans boy, Alex (“V” in their article), starved to death due to disordered eating and a lack of appropriate support. According to an article published by RNZ, it seems that most health professionals, school staff, and support agencies were affirming of his trans identity and did their best to help educate his family. But, his family refused to accept that he was trans, and believed he would still be alive if he had received LESS support for being trans. Warning; this article was written using extensive quotes from the family, and at their request misgenders him throughout. You can read the article here Teenager starves to death alone in emergency accommodation.
> 
> According to his parents, his long term psychiatrist advised the family that the cause of his disordered eating was trying to suppress puberty, citing ‘curvy’ body shape, and recommended not affirming his gender. But this young trans person should have been receiving care for both disordered eating and gender-related (or transition) healthcare. It is not possible to treat a person’s gender-related eating disorders without acknowledging the person’s gender. The article made no mention of puberty blockers or hormone treatment, which is first line treatment for trans people with disordered eating that is related to gendered appearance. Research shows that disordered eating for trans people with gender-related motivations is substantially decreased by getting transition related healthcare. Counting Ourselves (2025) found that 39% of trans youth respondents met the threshold for the likely presence of an eating disorder
> 
> While Alex lived with his parents, they opposed him being trans, and were stopping him from using the internet or having a phone, which suggests that his access to a supportive trans community was heavily limited. He was happy to move out, but it seems that he remained relatively isolated while in the care of the state.
> 
> Family support and/or connection to a supportive community is critical for a trans person to survive.  According to Counting Ourselves (2019), if transgender young people had support from at least half of their family or whānau, they were almost half as likely (at 9%) to have attempted suicide in the last 12 months compared to those who said most of their family or whānau were unsupportive (at 17%). In Counting Ourselves (2025), participants who said most or all of their family members were supportive of their gender were twice as likely to report very good or excellent mental health.
> 
> Trans youth need to be allowed to exist and have their self-reported sex (or gender) respected. They need access to puberty blockers and transition healthcare. If they have disordered eating, it needs to be understood in the context of their gender. This tragic death could have been prevented.

> 
> The parents of a teenager who starved to death alone in emergency accommodation believe that multiple agencies failed in their care.
> 
> Their only child was able to keep them at a distance on the grounds they did not accept the teen was transgender - an identity the parents say the teen later abandoned.
> 
> However, the couple allege that while attentive to their child's gender identity, various care professionals failed to adequately respond to the threat from a long-standing eating disorder.
> 
> "Mama, I love you"
> The 13-year-old girl in the photo, whom RNZ is calling "Vanessa" at the parents' request, is dark-eyed and dark-haired like the teen's mother.
> 
> Vanessa looks shy about having the photo taken.
> 
> It's the kind of photo any proud mum might have on her phone ... the next photo is not.
> 
> It's of naked, skeleton-like remains, shrouded in the black nylon of a police body-bag.
> 
> That photo was taken on the day in January 2023 that the teenager was found dead in a locked motel room, about an hour from the parents' South Island home.
> 
> Vanessa had just turned 17.
> 
> The last time Vanessa''s parents had heard from the teen was two days previously: a message at 7pm to the mother, Catherine*.
> 
> "She texted me 'Mama, I love you'.
> 
> "She didn't want to see us because she didn't want us to know how bad it was, the anorexia," Catherine says softly.
> 
> "But you can see she suffered."
> 
> Catherine and her husband are still waiting for a date for the coroner's inquiry into their only child's death.
> 
> There is no doubt of the immediate cause of death: cachexia (extreme wasting), due to anorexia nervosa, according to the post-mortem report.
> 
> The teenager weighed 30kg, which was 17kg less than she weighed as an 11-year-old.
> 
> However, the parents believe it was the lack of adequate oversight by multiple professionals in health, education and social welfare in the last few months of Vanessa's life, which allowed that death.
> 
> All the government and community agencies involved - Health NZ, Oranga Tamariki, the Ministry for Social Development, the Education Ministry, Presbyterian Support and the Salvation Army - have expressed their sympathy for the family, but said they were unable to comment as the case was still before the coroner.
> 
> Much-loved only child
> Vanessa was an extremely bright, sensitive, cheerful pre-schooler with a lively curiosity about the world.
> 
> An only child, born to her parents late in life, Vanessa was "dearly hoped for, least expected", Catherine said.
> 
> However, the family's happy, ordinary life was shattered when Vanessa was sexually molested at the age of five by an older child at school.
> 
> The Rape Crisis counsellor who helped the family through the ghastly aftermath warned her parents that puberty was often a trigger point for children who had suffered trauma.
> 
> "And that's exactly what happened to Vanessa. She was nearly 12, just at the start of puberty, when anorexia hit."
> 
> Over the next five years, Vanessa would be hospitalised 10 times.
> 
> Catherine said Vanessa would starve herself to the point where it threatened to damage the teen's heart.
> 
> "She was overwhelmingly fixated with exact measurements, calories calculated, over-exercising, drawing disturbing and macabre images, hiding food in her room."
> 
> Vanessa sought out pro-anorexia websites, connected with like-minded people via the Discord app and tried to hide the weight loss.
> 
> "She used to drink litres and litres of water before a check-up when she knew she would be weighed. We turned the water off, but then she would go drink from the neighbour's hose."
> 
> Vanessa became increasingly argumentative, and even violent towards them, Catherine said.
> 
> Several times they were forced to barricade themselves in a room and call the police.
> 
> "When you are very hungry, you are angry all the time. When she had these explosions, we wondered where she got the energy from."
> 
> Treatment
> A psychiatrist from the local Child, Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), in a report dated December 2017, noted Vanessa "resists the idea that she has an Eating Disorder".
> 
> "She has various rationalisations for her eating patterns and weight loss. She would like to contest the ridiculous nature of having to gain weight and eat in prescribed ways with anyone who would enter that debate with her."
> 
> Vanessa continued to insist the obsession with weight and diet was "normal" and "all teenage girls were similar".
> 
> The teen also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and was diagnosed with autism at 15.
> 
> The parents believe the "black and white thinking" that is characteristic of autism intensified her anorexic ideation.
> 
> Vanessa exercised obsessively - running on the spot in her bedroom or the bathroom, according to one medical note.
> 
> "During admission in hospital, mother said that despite being hooked up to an IV line with her mother lying on the bed beside her, Vanessa was doing sit-ups."
> 
> While continuing to deny she had an eating disorder, Vanessa would become "oppositional and defensive" when her behaviour was challenged, the clinician wrote.
> 
> "Life saving" court order
> In January 2019, when she was 13, a Family Court judge put Vanessa under a compulsory treatment order, at the recommendation of her doctors.
> 
> "This was a huge relief to us," Catherine said.
> 
> "This court order was the only barrier between her and her death. The only thing stronger than her obsession [with not eating] was her fear of going back to hospital. She hated it so much."
> 
> In a letter to the judge, her father described his fears for her life, which (as he now notes) "seem sadly prescient":
> 
> "Before you, you see my beautiful, vibrant, inquisitive daughter, with an intelligence well beyond her tender years. What you cannot see is the year or more of anguish, hopelessness and tears that began when our warm and wonderfully ordinary family life was turned upside down by the arrogant, manipulative and destructive mental illness called Anorexia Nervosa."
> 
> Since its onset, Vanessa had "practically never eaten of her own volition", he wrote.
> 
> "That her death may well be a painful and premature one is the bitterest and most crushing possibility. What parent could ever envisage such a hell?"
> 
> School life
> Some things were going well for Vanessa.
> 
> School work was easy, Catherine said, and she was years ahead of her peers in maths, sciences, computer programming and other subjects.
> 
> She met a boy.
> 
> At high school, she was also introduced to the concept of gender diversity and at some point in 2021 became non-binary.
> 
> Vanessa adopted a gender neutral name ("V") and pronouns, which were used by staff and students.
> 
> However, Catherine said immediately after a messy break-up with the boyfriend, Vanessa started identifying as a boy.
> 
> At home, the arguments were now about gender identity as well as food, with Vanessa/V accusing the parents of being transphobic.
> 
> "She tried to 'educate' us by sharing influencer videos. She said she must be right because all the health professionals and online articles agreed with her."
> 
> Some clinicians quickly affirmed V's boy identity.
> 
> However, Catherine said the teen's long-term psychiatrist was sceptical.
> 
> "The psychiatrist advised us that Vanessa was using the transgender identity as a mask for her continuing anorexia - that Vanessa was saying the reason she didn't want a curvy, female body was not because she was suffering from anorexia, but because she was really a boy.
> 
> "The psychiatrist recommended not affirming Vanessa's transgender identity."
> 
> The school clashed with the parents over their refusal to buy the teen a boy's uniform.
> 
> "The Dean rang, said we were being ridiculous, and gave Vanessa special permission to wear her own trousers at school, thus undermining both us and the psychiatrist who had known Vanessa for five years."
> 
> In year 10, Vanessa enrolled with Te Kura, the Correspondence School, as V.
> 
> Because all their child's schoolwork and social life were now online, it became difficult for Catherine and her husband to limit computer use.
> 
> "Vanessa didn't have a phone yet. There were rules about handing in the computer at a certain time each night but it was a battle every day."
> 
> Leaving home
> Vanessa/V left home in March 2022.
> 
> In an email to the psychiatrist, the father described an escalation in "ritualistic" behaviour and highly-restricted eating, abusive language and paranoia in the lead up.
> 
> On 8 March, he had asked to check the computer.
> 
> "It rapidly escalated into a battle over the device ... very quickly we both realised she had something to hide (hence the screaming and determination to hold the computer).
> 
> "Although we retreated downstairs to a locked room, she kept screaming and violently kicking the door."
> 
> They called 111.
> 
> While they waited for police to arrive, their neighbour watched over Vanessa from a safe distance.
> 
> "She reported that Vanessa was screaming, kicking and head-butting the wall before running inside."
> 
> The police found a hammer stashed in a bedroom and the teenager hiding in the roof cavity.
> 
> A check of the computer later revealed Vanessa/V had been using the Discord app and viewing (with other users) disturbing material.
> 
> On 13 March, the teenager moved in with the family of an ex-classmate.
> 
> Vanessa/V was referred to Oranga Tamariki and a caseworker arranged for the host family to receive an Unsupported Child Benefit.
> 
> The parents were asked to write a letter to Work and Income confirming they could no longer have Vanessa living at home.
> 
> "Vanessa seems receptive to this idea, probably not least because she now has practically unlimited use of a computer," her father noted drily to the psychiatrist.
> 
> Then on 7 April, the court lifted the compulsory treatment order at the request of the CAMHS.
> 
> "Her psychiatrist said to me, 'Let's give her an opportunity'," Catherine said.
> 
> "And I was like, 'To do what? To die?'. Because we knew that she would just stop eating.
> 
> "My daughter wrote in her diary the only reason she kept eating was because she didn't want to go back to hospital."
> 
> That month Vanessa/V was also discharged from CAMHS, which had been treating the anorexia and other mental problems.
> 
> The reason given to the parents was that Vanessa was "not engaging", Catherine said.
> 
> "Of course she wasn't engaging. She was a teenager with a serious eating disorder."
> 
> Vanessa texted her parents that if they would not accept her as a boy, it was better they did not see each other at all.
> 
> "We were devastated. We didn't know where to turn or what to do. I couldn't sleep or eat.
> 
> "Her father became introverted and silent."
> 
> They had no contact until August, when Vanessa caught Covid and texted her mother.
> 
> Catherine dropped off some supplies and after that they kept in touch everyday by text.
> 
> "We were so relieved that Vanessa was now talking to us again that we didn't press to see her. Slowly we began to rebuild our relationship."
> 
> At the same time, Vanessa's relationship with the host family broke down.
> 
> Family Works, a service run by Presbyterian Support, found the teenager emergency accommodation.
> 
> Catherine said Vanessa continued to keep them at a distance, but allowed them to supply various items, by dropping them off at an agreed location.
> 
> Catherine said it was not only the 16-year-old who excluded them from her life, but also the small army of professionals in health, education and welfare agencies, who had assumed responsibility for their child's care.
> 
> "Vanessa, and everyone who was supposed to help her, accepted the belief that we her parents, in not agreeing that she had become a boy, were uncaring bigots who deserved to be cut off."
> 
> Some of the caseworkers involved did not even know about the history of anorexia, Catherine said.
> 
> She did manage to see Vanessa in November 2022, at the motel where she was living.
> 
> "She had a self-contained apartment with her own bathroom and kitchenette.
> 
> "She was pleased and surprised to see me but was very emaciated."
> 
> "Sad child" living alone in a motel
> The motel manager told RNZ that she and V became very close in the three months they lived there - but she was not aware the teen's health was deteriorating.
> 
> "V was very anorexic when they came and continued to be so."
> 
> But because the teen always wore a puffer jacket and baggy clothes, it was hard to tell whether things were better or worse, she said.
> 
> "My concern was for that sad child.
> 
> "My main concerns were 'Can I help this person become more resilient? Can I help them find happiness? Can I help them get hold of life somehow and enjoy it?'."
> 
> The teenager repeatedly assured her they were "eating OK", and social workers from Housing First (run by the Salvation Army) regularly visited clients at the motel.
> 
> "To be honest I knew very little about anorexia, but I now know that people with anorexia are very good at covering what they are doing or not doing."
> 
> V frequently went food shopping and discussed food, there was "always food in the fridge".
> 
> "We only discovered afterwards that lot of food was returned to the shops and money refunded."
> 
> At Christmas, she gave V dinner and "treats".
> 
> "As far as I know, no-one else visited. We were the only ones who gave V any presents for Christmas or their birthday."
> 
> She described the teenager as "absolutely delightful".
> 
> "They couldn't make eye contact but weren't averse to physical contact.
> 
> "V would frequently ask me if it was alright to have a hug.
> 
> "The only time they got upset with me was when I suggested that at some point, they had to learn how to do some things for themselves because they would be living independently in the future, and they didn't want that.
> 
> "That scared them, they wanted to stay here.
> 
> "V told me this was the safest they had felt for years, here with us."
> 
> The last conversation she had with V was two days before they died, when she tried to get V to make their own bed.
> 
> "I refused to do it because I was trying to encourage them to do more things for themselves.
> 
> "V said to me 'L, do you hate me?'. And I said 'No, I love you, that's why I'm asking you to make your own bed'."
> 
> She found out later that V had persuaded another guest to make it for them.
> 
> "That guest is pleased the last thing they did for V was something kind."
> 
> V's death was a tragedy, she said.
> 
> "They were a lovely person - we laughed and chatted, it was a pleasure to know them and I'm just really happy that - at least for the time they were here - they enjoyed themselves, they felt safe, they were comfortable."
> 
> Parents see child for the last time
> Vanessa's parents both saw her for the last time on 1 January, 2023 - but only at a distance.
> 
> "She was wearing a puffer jacket in the middle of summer. She wouldn't let us near to see how thin she was, using the excuse 'You don't accept I'm a man'."
> 
> However, her parents said subsequently, Vanessa phoned her father and then her mother to say she was "seriously questioning the 'gender identity thing'" and wanted them to know she was indeed their daughter.
> 
> They were hopeful their child could be returning to them, but that was not to be.
> 
> In an email to V's GP, the Family Works team leader said the teenager had dropped "a significant amount of weight" since she had last seen him in early December.
> 
> "His weight loss alerted several staff members in the office. I spoke with V about his health and encouraged him to make an appointment with his GP to ensure he is getting the appropriate support."
> 
> The teenager reported feeling tired from exercising and "overwhelmed" due to autism.
> 
> "He fell to the ground at one point saying his legs were so tired, when I dropped him at home, he lifted his legs to get out of the car. He stated he has enough food and is eating well, as well as sleeping okay, however this is not obvious in his physical appearance."
> 
> The worker said she was "breaching his confidence" because she was so concerned for him and wanted to alert the doctor.
> 
> A GP appointment was booked for the next week - by then, however, the teenager would already be dead.
> 
> "I do not understand why no-one called an ambulance that day," Catherine said.
> 
> "How can it be that a child collapses in front of all these people [at the Family Works premises] and no-one calls an ambulance?"
> 
> It was the height of summer and temperatures were sweltering.
> 
> Catherine later heard the teenager had asked the motel manager for a walking stick and a hose to drink water from the tap without getting out of bed.
> 
> "The manager said she thought it was weird but did nothing about it. I asked her as calmly as I could 'A minor asks you for a walking stick and a hose to drink water from the tap - are you not going to anything about it?'.
> 
> "She got angry with me and said 'We are a motel, not social services'."
> 
> The motel manager told RNZ she did not recall any mention of a walking stick, but the comment about the hose pipe had been taken "out of context".
> 
> "V often made odd requests. With hindsight it possibly meant more than it sounded like, but it wasn't uncommon for certain requests that were unusual."
> 
> Catherine said Vanessa last left her motel room on a Thursday.
> 
> Saturday was her parents' wedding anniversary, and they decided to go for a drive in the country and were out of cellphone reception for a few hours.
> 
> After that final text on Saturday night, Vanessa could not be contacted.
> 
> "She would always text back because she knew I got worried. So we were worried."
> 
> On Monday, Catherine rang the motel, but the manager said if it was not a "professional call", she could not put it through.
> 
> So Catherine rang Vanessa's GP, who organised "a welfare check".
> 
> When Catherine rang the motel again, the phone was handed straight to a police officer.
> 
> "I knew immediately that Vanessa had died."
> 
> When they arrived at the motel, there was a stench.
> 
> Vanessa was lying in bed with her laptop propped up on her lap, dead two days.
> 
> "At the scene, the Police corrected us when we used Vanessa's name and insisted on using a male name and pronouns," remembers Catherine.
> 
> "I was so distressed by this."
> 
> Vanessa's parents believe the teenager's death was the result of the removal of the protections of the Compulsory Treatment Order nine months previously.
> 
> Catherine said it appeared there was "wilful blindness" on the part of those professionals, who were so focused on affirming Vanessa's gender identity, but did not pay the same attention to the eating disorder which would kill her.
> 
> Their crushing grief is made worse by the knowledge that so many chances were missed.
> 
> "Acknowledging and reporting her deterioration would have been a simple matter. Had they done so, our treasured daughter would still be alive."

> Press Release: Rights Aotearoa
> 
> Radio New Zealand has published one of the most ethically bankrupt pieces of journalism in its history, systematically erasing the identity of a deceased transgender youth to advance an anti-trans agenda orchestrated by known anti-transgender activist and bigot Fern Hickson.
> 
> Rights Aotearoa today reveals that RNZ's article "Teenager starves to death alone in emergency accommodation" fundamentally misrepresents the life and death of Alex, a 17-year-old trans man who died in 2023. The article, published on 12 June 2025, deliberately misgenders Alex throughout its 3,500 words, referring to him exclusively by his deadname and using female pronouns—a grotesque violation of journalistic ethics and human dignity.

> Rights Aotearoa was given access to over 6,000 messages written by Alex on an eating disorder support forum between 2022 and 2023. These messages unequivocally demonstrate:

> Alex consistently identified as male and used he/him pronouns. He had a very stable gender identity, in fact, which is the opposite of what the RNZ story asserts.

> He explicitly stated: "I do not go by my birth name any more as hearing/seeing it makes me very uncomfortable. I am trans and don't really associate that name with myself at all anymore"

> His greatest source of pain was his parents' refusal to accept his identity: "My parents act like I never came out to them... casually misgender and deadname me even when talking to others"
>
> He never renounced his transgender identity, contrary to what RNZ's article implies
>
> Angel, the forum moderator who knew Alex intimately through thousands of interactions, states categorically: "I want to say that Alex did not want to die from his eating disorder, and I fully believe that he would still be here today if he had been accepted for his identity."
> 
> Angel asked Rights Aotearoa to make sure Alex’s story was heard. We convened a zui of leading figures from the transgender, healthcare, and human rights communities, and we unanimously decided to give the leading journalist David Farrier access to the messages. His nuanced article, honouring the true story of Alex’s life, is available here: https://www.webworm.co/p/lifeanddeathofalex. The excellent NZ Herald journalist David Fisher has also been given access to the messages.

> Fern Hickson's Manipulative Agenda Exposed
> Evidence reveals that Fern Hickson of Resist Gender Education NZ actively "shopped around" this story to media outlets, ultimately finding a willing accomplice in RNZ journalist Ruth Hill. Within hours of publication, anti-trans activists celebrated on social media, with Ani O'Brien thanking Hickson for her "hard and determined work" in placing the story.
> 
> The article's framing precisely mirrors Resist Gender Education's ideological position—that transgender identity is a delusion that must be denied. RNZ failed to disclose Hickson's role or her organisation's anti-trans agenda, deceiving the public about the source and motivation behind this story.
> 
> Ruth Hill's Catastrophic Ethical Failure
> Ruth Hill has:
> 
> Wilfully misgendered a deceased youth throughout her article
> Failed to verify the accuracy of claims made by ideologically motivated sources
> Omitted crucial perspectives from those who actually knew Alex
> Published speculative assertions about Alex's death before any coronial findings
> Violated the most basic principles of ethical journalism
> This is not merely poor journalism—it is an act of posthumous violence against a vulnerable young person who died seeking acceptance.
> 
> Rights Aotearoa's Demands
> We demand the following actions from Radio New Zealand by 5pm today:
> 
> Immediate removal of the article from all RNZ platforms
> A comprehensive public apology acknowledging the harm caused by misgendering Alex and failing to disclose source bias
> A thorough examination of all the editorial processes that allowed this story to be published
> The dismissal of Ruth Hill for gross ethical violations that have brought RNZ into disrepute
> If these demands are not met by 5pm today, Rights Aotearoa will immediately proceed to the Human Rights Commission with a formal complaint regarding RNZ's discriminatory treatment of a deceased transgender person. We will rely on the Supreme Court’s findings in the case of Peter Ellis to seek justice for Alex posthumously. We will also add Sean Plunket and Lean Panapa from The Platform to the complaint.
> 
> The Human Cost
> This is not merely about journalistic standards. Alex was a brilliant, kind young person who loved deeply despite the rejection he faced. His story deserved to be told with dignity and truth. Instead, RNZ has weaponised his death to advance a harmful anti-trans narrative, compounding the very discrimination that contributed to his suffering.
> 
> As Alex's friend poignantly noted: "The original article seems to suggest that 'because social services focused so much on Alex's gender identity, they neglected his eating disorder'. It is deeply ironic then, that all of the conversation now seems to be around Alex's gender identity, and people are neglecting to raise awareness about the eating disorder that killed him."
> 
> A Betrayal of Public Trust
> RNZ, as New Zealand's public broadcaster, has a solemn duty to report the truth and present it fairly. By allowing itself to be manipulated by anti-trans activists, by erasing Alex's identity, and by publishing harmful speculation before coronial proceedings, RNZ has catastrophically failed in this duty.
> 
> The stakes could not be higher. Transgender youth in Aotearoa face extraordinary challenges. When our public broadcaster participates in their erasure—even in death—it sends a devastating message to every trans young person struggling to survive.
> 
> Rights Aotearoa will not allow this unconscionable act to stand. Justice for Alex demands nothing less than full accountability.

 


> PRESS RELEASE ON BEHALF OF VANESSA'S* PARENTS
> The Tragic Loss of Our Daughter, Vanessa*
> 
> It is with deep sadness that we, as the parents of Vanessa*, speak out against the sensationalised portrayal of our daughter’s life and death in a recent article by David Farrier. We are heartbroken by the story that has been shared publicly and deeply disappointed by the way Mr Farrier has weaponised Vanessa's* distress and struggles with complex mental illness.
> 
> We now are aware that New Zealand Herald journalist David Fisher is writing an article to amplify this further.
> First and foremost, we loved Vanessa*. She was our only child and her death has all but destroyed us.
> 
> We acknowledge that there was tension and conflict between Vanessa* and us. We discussed this in detail with Ruth Hill from Radio New Zealand. The challenges in our relationships were painful and it is appalling that the details of the most devastating aspects of our family life is being used by activists to paint us as bad parents.
> 
> Children often become very angry with their parents when we have to assert our authority and make decisions we consider to be best for them. We made Vanessa* eat when she did not want to, we took away her access to the internet when she was using it to take part in pro-anorexia forums, we took her to doctors and psychiatrists when she wanted to be left alone with her eating disorder, and yes, we had her hospitalised when she was dangerously ill due to that disorder. She was very angry with us. Doing the right thing by our child was often the very hardest thing.
> 
> We object to the portrayal of Vanessa’s* struggles with anorexia, autism, and gender as though they were simply the result of our lack of understanding or ignorance. To be clear, Vanessa* was not “lost” due to her 'gender identity'. Her anorexia, a long-standing and deeply painful struggle, was the cause of her death. She was 30 kilograms when she died. That is what killed her.
> 
> Parenting is never easy, but when your child is autistic, has anorexia, and is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, the challenges can feel overwhelming. As parents, we have always done our best, but the complexity of Vanessa’s* needs and the trauma she carried meant we often had to be the 'bad guys' advocating for her best interests when her mental illness was telling her to harm herself.
> 
> We urge those who have shared Vanessa’s* story to focus on the real issue: that a 17-year-old died of starvation in the care of the state. It was a systemic failing of our public service, along with her school. They facilitated alienating her from the very people who loved her and put her before all else - her parents. Our experience should sound the alarm about the way parental rights are quickly disregarded by our government and school system. In all but a few sad circumstances, family and parents are best placed to advocate for their children and ensure they get the care they need. We were alienated from our child and then those who drove that alienation left her to die.
> 
> We are disgusted that David Farrier and Paul Thistoll have taken it upon themselves to publicly attack us, labelling us as "bad" parents. These two men have no understanding of our family, no insight into the personal struggles we've faced, and most importantly, no connection to Vanessa*. They didn’t know her, and they certainly didn't witness the heartache we endured in trying to support our child. To have our parenting criticised by individuals who were never part of our lives, who never walked in our shoes, and who had no firsthand experience of the complexities of Vanessa's* struggles is not only unjust but deeply malevolent. They have no right to use our grief as a platform to push their own narratives or to vilify us in ways that are frankly cruel.
> 
> Mr Farrier and Mr Thistoll are two opportunistic men who are picking over the tragic remains of our daughter's life like vultures.
> Our grief is as acute today as it was the day we were told our only child was dead. We will never stop mourning her and wishing her life could have been different. Mr Farrier and Mr Thistoll will have forgotten about her by next week.
> 
> Vanessa’s parents
> 
> *Vanessa is the name we have chosen for our daughter, to protect our family’s anonymity.
