> My friend Mark was a trans man. He was 16 years old when he overdosed in a crappy appartment in Vironas, Athens. He was not living with his parents but with some teenagers who loved and accepted him, two out of the three were arrested as accesories to the murder. He was a man and he was an addict and he said he wanted to start high school again and have a life. The addiction was too much, it was caused largely by the hostile environment greek society and his parents put on him, the same parents that spread the news with a fake name and a fake story and got his closest friends arrested He took Sisa, Heroin weed and epilepsy medicine and died 18 or so of november after 2 week or so long coma. Mark was a little shit and i loved him to death instagram: https://instagram.com/marko_locoo?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA== email me if you need any other information. do not publicize my name in any way shape or form. thank you

> Byron: Who led to the death of 16-year-old Markella – The dialogues between the gang members
> The student who lost her life in Byron had fallen into the "claws" of a criminal drug-trafficking organization, as the ruthless members of the ring they had turned into a drug test animal, probably also a "steamer", in order to approach other minors.
> 
> By THEODOSIS PANOU - SOURCE: Realnews
> 
> The case of 16-year-old Markella, who died so unjustly, has shocked the whole of Greece, as the child had been fighting for days to keep alive in the ICU where she was hospitalized , after falling into a coma due to an overdose of a cocktail of powerful drugs.
> 
> According to information, as emerged from the investigation carried out by EL.AS., the substances were given to the minor by an organized drug trafficking gang, consisting of at least seven people. Two of them have already been remanded in custody, while three others were released with restrictive conditions, but it is expected that they will also be sent to prison, as, after the death of the 16-year-old, the charges against them will be upgraded. Furthermore, the Police are looking for two other members, including a 27-year-old man, who is considered the organizer and informal leader of the spiral.
> 
> Their practice of drug trafficking is considered "satanic" by the Police, as it seems that they recruited students and used them as "vapers", after first taking care to get them addicted to substances. That's how they seem to have met the unfortunate girl, who has been using since she was 14. In fact, the police consider it very possible that the girl was then used for trafficking, after first introducing her to the world of drugs. At the same time, from the conversations that the authorities have in their possession, it appears that the criminal organization wanted to expand even to the center of Athens, because there the trafficking yields greater profits due to increased demand. As it emerged from the investigations, the young men systematically trafficked hard drugs in Byron and the southern suburbs. The Police are certain that they were selling drugs in Alimos and Glyfada, where they used an abandoned building in order to hide the quantities of drugs.
> 
> Connections
> The members of the ring seem to have been able to procure all kinds of drugs, such as cocaine, heroin and even "shisha", the "cocaine of the poor", as this very dangerous drug is called . This fact, if nothing else, shows that they had connections with major drug dealers, while in some of the conversations they had with each other, which is now in the hands of the Police, allegedly talking about an order from the Netherlands. Everything shows that Byron's gang wanted to expand and gain more influence, even exploiting high school students. From their conversations it appears that they were even trading pure cocaine, and in fact for the amount of 80 euros per gram.
> 
> Indicative is the conversation of two members of the spiral, who arrange buying and selling:
> 
> – Mine told me about 2 gr. finally "cock" for tomorrow.
> 
> - Ok, it's 180, tomorrow as soon as I wake up I'll send you to bring me the letters or even now if you want.
> 
> – Ninety a gram, can't you leave me 80? Just like last time.
> 
> – Bro, the other time he got more, I don't put the price.
> 
> – He had taken two but, OK, it's not for me either and he told me for 80, just like the other time, otherwise void.
> 
> In another conversation, the same persons arrange the purchase of the synthetic drug MD, a highly addictive and dangerous substance:
> 
> – Bro, I have md 35 euros per gram, ak 47 black and lemon.
> 
> – And it also has SKANK, golden, with this you get everything, at 50 g. with 7.5. And the MD in a quantity of 20 per gram.
> 
> The fateful night
> Shocking are the dialogues of the members of the spiral when the 16-year-old has now fallen into a coma, as that night she had used intravenous heroin, smoked hashish and "shisha", and had also taken a pill for epilepsy called "Lyrica". resulting in her ultimately losing her life.

> 
> It is worth noting that one more man also escapes arrest, who together with the two remands, allegedly abandoned the unfortunate 16-year-old and her friend before the ambulance arrived, because they were afraid that they would get involved with the police, as they have all been arrested for drugs in the past.
> 
> In fact, one asked the 16-year-old's friend to clean up the area so that the substances would not be found.
