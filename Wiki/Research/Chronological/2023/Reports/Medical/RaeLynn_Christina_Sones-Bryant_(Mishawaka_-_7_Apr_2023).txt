> Raymond was a spunky, go getter with an outgoing personality who loved to make others laugh. Often pegged as the class clown, he had a beautiful smile and a love of music. He often enjoyed going to concerts. Which include bands such as Korn, Sevendust, Creed, Shinedown, Skillet Seether and Godsmack, to name a few. Avid fan of the 49ers. Going on a motorcycle ride. Even though he had physical challenges, he never let that slow him down and when his body didn’t allow for things to happen, he would make it up with his heart. He always wanted others to be happy. He aspired to be a youth minister one day and was a member of EMM church. He was also a member of a  Signed Sealed and Delivered Ministry. R.C. went to Battell,   Beiger and Emmons Elementary Schools, Jackson Middle School and Christian Center for High School.  A special thank you to Stacy, Donna, and the people with Elara Caring (Gavin, Ashley, Amy, and Angelique) we appreciate everything you have done being there when we were not able to and being a big support through it all.
