> What killed Flavia Herrera?
> It is not known. They have said insecticide poisoning, but Pepe Herrera, in Caibarién, says that he does not believe that or any other story, that the authorities have not wanted to thoroughly investigate the death of his daughter. He claims to have given them sufficient evidence, but they take advantage of the fact that he and his wife cannot go to Havana due to various health conditions.
> 
> On Thursday, June 22, 2023, Flavia Herrera Rodríguez, also known as La Veneno, a 30-year-old trans woman, born in Caibarién, Villa Clara province, died in Havana around seven at night, presumably due to an arrest. breathing while they injected silicone into his buttocks.
> 
> The news of his death was confirmed on social networks by friends, close people and family. One of her first was her inseparable friend Lulú, who, a day later, on June 23, said goodbye to her with an emotional post on Facebook :
> 
> “[…] you don't know the great pain you leave me with your departure, see you in the afterlife and I know that wherever you are you will take care of me because you know how much I love you with all my heart, I can't explain to you how it is that I you leave and how much I will need you, my sister, may you rest in peace…”
> 
> Later, so did her friend Rubí Ramires ( sic ), who expressed on her Facebook profile that despite the short time she had known her, the deceased young woman had shown her what it meant to be a true friend, a sister.
> 
> The comments left by other users ranged from astonishment and condolences to demands for justice, so that his case would not go unpunished and the causes of his death would be clarified. Several versions circulated from very early on. Some pointed to a possible murder. The most repeated is the one that maintains that Flavia died while silicone was being injected into her buttocks, while another suggests that she died from poisoning. In both versions, it is added that there was theft of the cash with which he would pay for the aesthetic procedure, his cell phone, the leftover product and other valuable belongings, as detailed from a Facebook profile called Santy Pérez Ruiz.
> 
> This same profile—apparently false and later deleted—claimed that Flavia was scammed and murdered. She urged the relevant authorities to obtain her call log to find the last person she spoke to before she died and the “recordings of private cameras with the group that kidnapped her in the middle of the street, subsequently inducing her to drink what killed her.” ”. The post did not provide further details or explain which cameras she was referring to or their location.

> The Cuban platform for support and accompaniment to people in situations of sexist violence YoSíTeCreo En Cuba requested help to seek more information about the death of the young woman, and to date maintains it on a list of cases that need access to police investigation.
> 
> “Look prettier. What Flavia wanted was to look prettier, more feminine. She just talked about it.”
> 
> In mid-June, days before her death, Flavia traveled to Caibarién and met Sussi Carrillo, one of the friends she always saw when she returned to her city. She was at her house. They had pizza and a smoothie for lunch, and in the afternoon she left on the Caibarién-Havana bus. She had brought the silicone that she was going to inject. Sussi saw the knobs. There were three.
> 
> It was not the first time that some part of the body was stuffed. He had previously injected his face illegally in Santa Clara and it swelled every so often. In addition to her cheekbones, she injected her lips and chin. As a result of this practice, he more than once had to go urgently to hospitals in Havana and undergo antibiotic treatments.
> 
> Sussi shows a photo of Flavia before filling her face, when she was at her house and shared with her and her children at Christmas 2022, and another after her facial feminization treatments. “She was another person. If you look closely you know it's her because of the tattoo on her arm, because her face was no longer the same. “She snubbed him,” she explains. She confesses that it is rumored that she did not die from the infiltration of silicone into her buttocks, that they never injected her, although there are audios where she warns that the person who is going to do it to her is already there, that she will later writes.
> 
> He confirms that for some it was a murder, and that some valuable belongings were stolen, since the relatives were only given a chain pendant, two pairs of earrings and a loose ring.
> 
> If the close people who were contacted and the acquaintances, who expressed it through comments in the publications about her death, agree on something, it is that Flavia was very loved, she had no problems with anyone, “she was not poisonous,” nor conflictive. She always made people laugh with her witticisms. In Caibarién, her neighbors remember her drinking coffee at Lourdes' house, doing keratin for Ñaña, “fucking” with Lola throughout the neighborhood saying that she was the prettiest, that they should get ready, that when she injected her buttocks and came back, Caibarién I was going to shake. There wasn't going to be a “naughty thing” that didn't have to do with her.
> 
> “I can't explain how his case has been so ignored,” Sussi reflects. “I don't know if it's because he was trans… or because he got upset and that's it. But his life has been worth less than that of a dog, because they kill a dog and two million come out asking for justice.”
