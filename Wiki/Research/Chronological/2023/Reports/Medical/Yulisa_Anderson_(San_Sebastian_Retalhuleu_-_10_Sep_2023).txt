> We deeply regret the passing of Yulisa Anderson, a brave Trans Woman from San Sebastián Retalhuleu, Canton Ixpatz. Her death, due to health complications, reminds us of the urgent need to ensure trans women's right to health is full compliance and protection.
> 
> We call on the State to take concrete and effective measures that prevent the loss of more companions like Yulisa. We honor her memory and will continue to fight so that no Trans Woman has to face barriers to access health care. Rest in peace, Yulisa.
