> Sources claim Marilyn was adopted from her the Navajo Nation into a Hispanic/white family who rejected her when she came out as gay and then transgender. Marilyn was often homeless and struggled to survive. But that’s not the story you see on Facebook and other social media feeds. Instead she shares her style and movie icons, posts about Pride events, and interacts with her friends.

> 
> Rest in power, Marilyn. Thank you for all that you did for the community, both LGBTQ and larger community. I am so sorry for the many ways in which we let you down and disregarded your needs. It is a poor reflection on all of us that we cannot even arrange for your remains to be returned.
