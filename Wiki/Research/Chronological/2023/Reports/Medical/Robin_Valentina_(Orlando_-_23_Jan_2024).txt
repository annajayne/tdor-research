clinical neglect


> Robin Valentina, 28, was a Black non-binary person who appears to have died of medical neglect on Jan. 23, 2024 in Kissimmee, Florida.



> Hi, my name is Jasmine and Robin Valentina was my dear cousin who passed January 23, 2024.
> 
> Robin was a 28 year-old non-binary person (pronouns: they/them/theirs) who graduated from School of Visual Arts in New York for cartooning. They decided to move back to DC after receiving their degree to teach as an art teacher in Maryland. After Covid-19 hit, they relocated to Orlando, Florida to start living their dreams and start training to become a wrestler. As with all of us, life happens and can side-track us but they were determined to stay steadfast in their goal of taking care of their body and being healthy.
> 
> On January 20, 2024; Robin went to HCA Florida Osceola Hospital complaining of stomach cramps and pain which later found out came from issues with their pancreas. My aunt was told this hospital does not remove pancreas. None of the doctors or staff were able to identify that not only was their pancreas in jeopardy but their liver also began to fail drastically. My aunt was notified after Robin spent 3 days in the hospital room alone. She traveled from Maryland to Florida to check on her child. When she arrived because she was upset of the lack of care her non-insured child was receiving; she was told to leave by security. After 20 minutes of her departure, Robin went into cardiac arrest and died alone on January 23, 2024.
> 
> Their death was preventable but because these doctors saw an African American, non-binary, non-insured patient; the doctors did very little to save their life! My aunt begged for the doctors to administer more antibiotics to any infections in their body, Robin's blood pressure was very high the entire time they were there but no bp meds were prescribed. They developed jaundice which is the first sign of liver failure but when my aunt asked if anything was being done to help their liver; her pleads went ignored. She had to watch as people who have taken an Hippocratic Oath to save lives no matter whether they can pay or not just treated her child as if they were waiting for them to die!. The Florida healthcare system MUST do better! Robin was a GREAT artist who loved to draw and express themselves unapologetically and they couldn't have cared less!
> 
> My aunt never planned to bury her child! In these days and ages who does?! All she wants to do now is bring her child back home so she can give them a nice memorial and proper send-off but before we can even focus there; we have to get Robin's body back from Orlando to Maryland which alone is $10k. In the economy we are in; my family is ever so grateful for anything that can be donated today to bring our loved one home to rest. Robin was THEE light in our lives and without them; it feels like dark days are ahead especially when they had soooo much potential to become a great among the GREATS!
> 
> Thank you, Robin for sharing your artistry with the world and now you can soar above the clouds!
> 
> Thank you for your time.
