Klaus Howard Smith and Robert Lyons (known as British Sterling), both 25, were found stabbed to death. Sunday, Oct. 15., in their Buckhead residence. Two 18-year-old youths, Alfred E. Yarborough and Richard A. Ford of Southeast Atlanta, were charged with the murders. Ford, who has been AWOL from the Army since June 7, turned himself over to the police Sunday evening.

Ford stated that he and Yarborough scored some "narcotics" on the Strip and, according to the Constitution, met Lyons "in a lounge off Monroe Drive." People who saw the three men later in the evening, however, said that the meeting took place on Cypress St., a cruising  place for Gay men, and that they went on from there to the Cove, a Gay bar on Monroe Drive. After a couple of stops at friends' homes. the trio drove to British's house.

Yarborough said he had been taking acid, that everything got hazy, and he remembers fighting with the two victims. No one was aware of Klaus sleeping in the foyer until he was awakened by Yarborough shouting.

Klaus and British were well known in Gay circles. British, a Black native of Philadelphia, was a former Miss Gay Atlanta. Klaus met British at Oglethorpe University, from which they graduated. British did drag shows at the Sweet Gum Head.

Straight papers and television whitewashed any reference to Gayness. For example, the greater part of a Constitution article eulogizes Klaus as an active Church member and Boy Scout leader. It even emphasises one of his "many good deeds." But little mention is made of British and no mention is made of his occupation or interests. Their relationships are referred to as "acquaintances." British died lying naked in bed with his "acquantance," Yarborough.
