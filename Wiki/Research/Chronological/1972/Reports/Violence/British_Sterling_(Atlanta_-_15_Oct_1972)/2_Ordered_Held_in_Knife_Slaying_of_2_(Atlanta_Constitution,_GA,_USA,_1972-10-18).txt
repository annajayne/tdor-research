===== 2 Ordered Held in Knife Slaying of 2 =====

Two men Tuesday were ordered held on charges of murder and robbery in connection with the knife slayings of a Scoutmaster and another man following an hour-long hearing in Municipal Court.

They were Alfred Eugene Yarbrough. 18, of 819 Harold Ave. SE. and Richard Allen Ford, 18. of 211 Wilbur Ave. SE.

Calvin Cole, Assistant Fulton County District Attorney, said the charges would be presented Friday to the Fulton County Grand Jury.

Detective G. F. Eskew said the two were charged in the slayings of Klaus Howard Smith and Robert Lyons, both 25, whose bodies were found Sunday at 3765 N. Stratford Drive NE.

Eskew said a stereo taken from the N. Stratford Drive address had been recovered.

Yarbrough and Ford, through their attorneys, Ed Garland and John Nuckoils, pleaded not guilty in the hearing before municipal Judge T. C. Little.
