> July 10, 2025 - 11:43 AM
> 
> 
> The family of Ellen Frances Hulett , a 24-year-old trans woman who died on June 23 “under horrible and inhumane circumstances” at the Immigration Detention Center in the community of Haina , in the Dominican Republic , is crying out for justice.
> 
> With a message titled “Help us bring Ezra home and seek the truth ,” the young woman’s relatives requested public help, through a GoFundMe account , to, among other things, achieve the repatriation of the body to the United States .
> 
> “Ezra had a gentle soul, a serene presence, and an extraordinary mind. She was deeply compassionate, sensitive, and brilliant: someone who navigated the world with a quiet kindness,” her loved ones wrote on the aforementioned platform.
> 
> For context, they detailed that he was born at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, New York, grew up in Clifton Park and attended Karigon Elementary and Gowana Middle schools, and earned an academic scholarship to study at Emma Willard School in Troy.
> 
> “Ezra was a person living with significant mental illness and the after-effects of childhood trauma. Missing in Puerto Rico since March, she was detained in the Dominican Republic while traveling from Puerto Rico, allegedly for not carrying proper documentation,” her family revealed.
> 
> In the publication, her relatives detailed that, during her arrest and interrogation, Dominican authorities recognized that Ezra was in an apparent psychological crisis: scared, disoriented, and with incoherent speech.
> 
> “However, instead of seeking immediate medical attention, hospitalizing him, or contacting the U.S. Embassy to notify his family, Ezra was held for more than two months in barbaric conditions at the Haina Immigration Detention Center, a facility already under investigation for corruption, overcrowding, and deplorable and unsanitary conditions,” they said.
> 
> In this regard, they reported that, for most of her time in detention, the young woman was placed in the men's block of the aforementioned center. They added that in the last two weeks—before her death—she was transferred to the women's section.
> 
> “One person, Carlos Sánchez, a human rights attorney with the National Human Rights Council, heard about an unknown detainee suffering abuse and showing signs of mental illness. He recognized her suffering and worked tirelessly on Ezra's behalf to intervene in the final weeks of his life,” the family wrote on GoFundMe.
> 
> On his own initiative, they said, the lawyer "fought to uncover his identity and filed a habeas corpus petition with the San Cristóbal criminal court to challenge the legality of the detention, request medical intervention, and have the courts recognize Ezra's basic human rights."
> 
> Despite this, the situation didn't change until she was found dead on June 23. "Her death, like her arrest, was completely preventable and deeply unjust. We are heartbroken. We are grieving. And we are seeking answers ," they said.
> 
> Given the situation, they explained that they are requesting financial assistance to, first, transport the young woman's body back to the United States, "where she can finally rest with love and dignity," and then, fund a second independent autopsy in that country, "since the true cause of death is still unclear."
> 
> "We believe a thorough postmortem examination is essential to achieve clarity and accountability," they commented.
> 
> They also reported that they need to hire a lawyer to bring his body home and investigate the results of the autopsy performed by Dominican authorities. "Furthermore, Ezra's death raises many questions; if we could answer only one, it would be to understand why this happened in the first place," they emphasized.
> 
> “Between the international repatriation of Ezra's body, transportation costs, the independent autopsy, and the hiring of a human rights attorney, the costs will range between $25,000 and $45,000,” said the family, which has so far raised $7,681 from 110 donations.
> 
> “Confirmation of Ezra's repatriation must be made immediately. Otherwise, the Dominican Republic will proceed with cremation, which would result in the irreversible loss of vital evidence. This is urgent. Every hour counts,” they stated.
> 
> Why this matters
> In answering why this case should matter, the young woman’s family noted that “Ezra’s death occurred in a place where there was no one who spoke his language (and no translator was offered to him), no legal assistance (despite Mr. Sanchez’s efforts), no medical care (despite his needs being acknowledged and his written requests for medication), no effort to authenticate his identity, and no real protections or basic human rights.”
> 
> “Every penny helps. Share this campaign as much as you can. Your support will help us bring Ezra home and honor the beautiful life he lived,” his loved ones said.

> 
> What do the Dominican authorities say?
> On June 24, the Dominican Republic's General Directorate of Migration (DGM) reported the death of the young woman. She was being held at the Haina Detention Center for immigration investigation and deportation proceedings.
> 
> According to information provided by the institution, "the woman, who appeared to have psychotic disorders, was arrested at the end of April in the eastern region of the country by members of the Tourist Police, who referred her to the DGM (General Directorate of General Administration of the General ...
> 
> "Since his identity and nationality were unknown, the Immigration Intelligence Directorate conducted the corresponding investigations, contacting various embassies accredited in the Dominican Republic," the agency added in a press release.
> 
> According to the DGM, the young woman's official identification was made possible on Wednesday, June 18, through facial recognition technology, after which her situation was notified to personnel at the United States Embassy in the country.
> 
> The DGM reported that, while in custody and undergoing deportation proceedings, the young woman was found lifeless on the morning of Monday, June 23.
> 
> "According to the initial evaluations conducted by the medical examiner and the DICRIM (Defense Forces of the Dominican Republic), the body shows no signs of violence. The body was transferred to the National Institute of Forensic Sciences (INACIF), where an autopsy is being performed to determine the exact cause of death," the DGM emphasized.
> 
> Before concluding her remarks, the DGM reiterated "its commitment to respect for human rights and transparency in the handling of the processes under its responsibility."

> EDITORIAL.- The family of U.S. citizen Ellen Frances Hewlett, who died in custody at the Jarabacoa resort, has opened a GoFundMe account to raise funds for the repatriation of her body and a second, independent autopsy to clarify the circumstances of her death.
> 
> The family estimates the total costs for transporting the body, an independent forensic examination, and specialized legal counsel to be between $25,000 and $45,000. This initiative arises from doubts about the circumstances surrounding the tourist's death while in the custody of authorities.
> 
> The preliminary death certificate states that Ellen Frances Hewlett died of respiratory failure, although the report also mentions pulmonary edema and acute heart failure as contributing factors. The victim was transgender, adding an additional layer of complexity to the case.
> 
> The family is seeking a second, independent medical opinion to more accurately determine the cause of death, especially considering that the death occurred while the victim was in official custody. This situation raises concerns about the treatment received and the conditions in which he was found at the time of his death.
> 
> The GoFundMe campaign reflects the family's determination to obtain clear answers about what happened and ensure a thorough investigation. The funds raised will allow not only for the repatriation of the body, but also for the hiring of specialized legal services to pursue the case.
> 
> The incident has generated both local and international attention, particularly due to the unique circumstances of the case and the victim's transgender status, which may have influenced her treatment during her detention.
