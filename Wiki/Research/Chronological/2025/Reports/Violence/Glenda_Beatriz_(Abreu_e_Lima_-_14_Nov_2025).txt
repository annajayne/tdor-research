> 
> According to the victim's family, she had gone to the home of her 34-year-old boyfriend, with whom she had been in a relationship for about a year. Glenda was accustomed to visiting her partner, but always maintained contact with her family.
> 
> Last Sunday, the mother began to worry because she hadn't received any news from her daughter. After a day without answers, she decided to look for her in hospitals and the Institute of Forensic Medicine, in addition to filing a police report.
> 
> On Friday morning, the family was informed that Glenda's body had been found inside a cistern at a house in Abreu e Lima.
> 
> The main suspect is Glenda's boyfriend, but it is still being investigated whether the residence where the body was found belongs to him or not.
> 
> Glenda's parents spoke to the suspect on Sunday (9), and he allegedly asked about her, stating that he gave R$ 100 to his girlfriend to buy marijuana. The father says he received a call early Tuesday morning asking for help, but he doesn't know if it was from the victim.
> 
> “I received a private call asking for help. But I was sure it wasn't my son, because we both have a stuttering disorder; when we're nervous, we stutter. I think it was the suspect.”
> 
> The man confessed to the crime, turned himself in at the Abreu e Lima Police Station, and was later transferred to the Homicide and Personal Protection Department (DHPP), where he was formally charged with concealing a corpse.
> 
> "He said they met through a social network and had a few dates where he gave her money to buy drugs, and they used them together. They had a falling out, and it happened again on Saturday. They were both highly intoxicated, and in the middle of the argument, the victim grabbed a knife to attack him. He defended himself by kicking her, then grabbed an axe and struck her in the back of the neck," said Detective Juliana Bernard, who handled the case.
> 
> Despite the fatal blow, the suspect also inflicted several stab wounds on the victim. He claims he was completely out of his mind, to the point of sleeping next to Glenda's body.
> 
> "The next day he said he woke up around 2 pm and realized what had happened when he looked at the body and the idea of hiding it in the cistern came to him," he continued.
> 
> According to the police chief, the man dragged the body to the cistern and then bought cement to cover it. He also set fire to the mattress and the murder weapons, and painted the room to mask the traces of blood.
> 
> "He said he took the cell phone, traded it for drugs, and hid in the woods until the day he turned himself in," said the police chief.
> 
> The suspect is expected to be indicted for homicide as the investigation unfolds, and will undergo a custody hearing tomorrow.
