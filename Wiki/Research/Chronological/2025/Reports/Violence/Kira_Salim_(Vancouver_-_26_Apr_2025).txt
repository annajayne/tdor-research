Kira Salim was one of eleven people killed in an attack on pedestrians in Vancouver (Canada) on 26 Apr 2025.

Kira was 34, identified as nonbinary and worked as a teacher-counsellor.





> Kira Salim, a 34-year-old teacher-counsellor at Fraser River Middle School and New Westminster Secondary School, has been identified as one of the victims in the April 26 events.
> 
> “It is with profound sadness that we share news that Kira Salim … was among those who lost their lives in the April 26 Lapu Lapu Day tragedy,” read a joint letter shared by board chair Maya Russell and superintendent Mark Davidson of the New Westminster school board.
> 
> “Kira was a valued member of our community whose wisdom and care for our middle and secondary school students had a powerful impact. Their work, and the great spirit they brought to it, changed lives.”
> 
> “The loss of our friend and colleague has left us all shocked and heartbroken. We extend our deepest condolences to Kira’s family, friends, and all who were fortunate to know them.”




> A trans teacher-counsellor who moved to Canada from Brazil so they could more safely be queer in public and an energetic five-year-old who was about to graduate from kindergarten are among those who were killed when a vehicle barrelled into a crowded street festival in Vancouver.
> 
> Kira Salim, 34, was identified as a victim in the festival attack by the New Westminster school district, which said the death has left friends and colleagues shocked and heartbroken.
> 
> Mx. Salim, who was trans and non-binary, arrived in New Westminster from Brazil three years ago looking for a safer place to be queer and out, friends said.
> 
> “They were such a big, energetic, beautiful, smiling human,” said Nadia Sorban, who met Mx. Salim when they taught at the American School in Rio de Janeiro a decade ago.
> 
> “It doesn’t feel fair for someone so caring and full of life to have been taken this way.”
> 
> Mx. Salim was among those at the Lapu Lapu Day block party in Vancouver on Saturday when a black SUV hurtled down the crowded, food truck-lined street, striking dozens of people without slowing. Eleven died, including Mx. Salim and the mother of a friend who accompanied them.
> 
> Vancouver Police Sergeant Steve Addison said Monday that the news is going to get harder before it gets easier.
> 
> “As we learn more about the victims in this horrific attack, the trauma is going to increase,” he said.
> 
> As of Monday, 16 others remained in hospital, according to B.C.’s Ministry of Health. Police said seven were in critical condition and three in serious condition.
> 
> A total of 32 patients were rushed to various hospitals Saturday; in all, 13 patients have been discharged with non-life-threatening injuries. Fundraising campaigns have been launched in efforts to support the families of the dead and injured.
> 
> Adam Lo has been charged with eight counts of second-degree murder, with more charges expected. Police say they are confident that the attack was not an act of terrorism, though a motive remains unclear. Mr. Lo had extensive contact with police and health professionals related to his mental health – including one with police from a neighbouring jurisdiction one day before the attack – but never of a criminal nature, police said.
> 
> Sgt. Addison said police executed a search warrant on Mr. Lo’s home to search for and seize evidence, and that whether there was any planning or intentionality to the attack will form part of their investigation.
> 
> Richard Le was also at the block party, with his wife Linh Hoang and their five-year-old daughter Katie, said his brother, Toan Le. At about 8 p.m., he texted his 16-year-old son Adam, who had stayed home to do homework, that they were about to return.
> 
> The three were killed minutes later.
> 
> “If I was to tell my brother and to everyone else, just cherish your loved ones and your friends, family, because you never know when they might not be around and you won’t have a second chance,” Toan Le said. “Take advantage of the time you have [with] them and cherish those people that you love.”
> 
> He described Katie has “super energetic,” saying “she had a very lovable personality, and she really loved just being around people.”
> 
> Mr. Le said his sister-in-law was a dedicated mother to Katie and stepmother to Andy.
> 
> “She’s a really good person,” he said.
> 
> Richard Le sold real estate for a Vancouver firm and coached badminton and tennis.
> 
> A statement from Royal Pacific Realty, where Mr. Le worked, said it has received an “outpouring of shock, grief, and condolences from colleagues, friends, and clients who knew and admired Richard.”
