> 31 year old Hairstylist and Black Trans Woman Kasí Rhea shot dead in Lynchburg, Virginia
> August 20, 2025 by Sue
> 
> A Black trans woman, Kasí Rhea, died from gun shot injuries in Lynchburg, Virginia on Monday, August 18, 2025.
> 
> The 31 year old woman was found dead in the front yard of a home in the 1100 block of Rivermont Avenue around 8:58 p.m. Law enforcement and media have misgendered and deadnamed Kasí .
> 
> At approximately 8:58 p.m., the Lynchburg Police Department and Lynchburg Fire Department responded to a malicious wounding call in the 1100 block of Rivermont Avenue.
> 
> Police told ABC3 News that when they arrived on the scene, they found someone dead in the yard. Police have confirmed that the victim suffered from a gunshot wound. It is unclear if this was Kasi’s house or another residence.
> 
> There is no further information from the investigation BUT I did see some of the media coverage updated around Kasi’s name and identity. Her friends and family likely advocated on her behalf, a too often step in the grieving process.
> 
> Honoring Kasí 
> Kasí  went to Heritage High School and studied at Strayer University. She used the nickname Kaeyy Holmes.
> 
> According to her social media profiles, Kasí was open about her struggle with depression. She professed herself a woman of faith. As recently as August 2023, she had her pick of three job offers including one she genuinely wanted. It also appears she was a talented and highly sought after hair stylist for children and adults.
> 
> Kasi was very into being a Scorpio and followed multiple astrology pages. Her music tastes include Cardi B, Ciara, and Missy Elliott
> 
> Kasi’s family have poured out their shock and grief – it appears she had a large extended family. Kasi’s Facebook page refers to her being married, but does not identify her spouse. Media reports that Kasi had a fiance. Perhaps that will become clearer in the coming days.
> 
> Context
> Kasí is the 14th trans person whose death has been reported in 2025. .She is the twelfth trans woman. She is the seventh Black trans woman, the tenth Black trans person, and the twelfth transgender person of color on our list.
> 
> Virginia has had its fair share of homicides -2023: Lexus Walker– 43' 2022: Jasper Aaron Lynch – 26, Ariyanna Mitchell –17; 2021 – EJ Boykin / Novaa Watson – 23 who was also killed by gun violence in Lynchburg.
> 
> Rest in power, Kasi. Thank you for the beauty and wonder you brought to this world with your artistry. Thank you for loving your family and friends, love that will echo through generations. I am sorry we did not create a safer, kinder world for you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
