> According to the ministerial investigation, between 8:00 a.m. on Sunday, August 3, and 5:50 a.m. on Monday, August 4, Daniel Alfonso stabbed Eli nearly 60 times in the chest with a knife he took from the kitchen, causing organ failure due to blood loss.

> 
> The accused was arrested yesterday evening, August 7, and brought before the Superior Court of Justice.

According to neighbors, she lived with more than five dogs and often shared time with her partner, with whom she frequently drank alcohol.
> 
> The body was found lying on a bed, covered with a blanket. The presence of the animals hampered emergency responders' initial access, so personnel from the Animal Care and Welfare Department (DABA) intervened to secure the dogs and allow authorities to enter.
> 
> Unofficially, neighbors recalled a disturbing incident: approximately eight years ago, Eli's then-boss was murdered in the same room as the beauty salon, sparking consternation and speculation about the coincidence of circumstances in this location.
