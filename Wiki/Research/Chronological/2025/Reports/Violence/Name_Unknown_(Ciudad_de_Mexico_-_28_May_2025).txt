> Transgender body found on children's playground in San Juan de Aragón
> 
> The morning of Wednesday, May 28, began with a discovery that has shocked the San Juan de Aragón neighborhood . In a children's play area, a few meters from a public elementary school , the body of a trans woman was found covered by a blanket.
> 
> The site, located between streets 507 and 509 of the Housing Unit , is frequented by people in vulnerable situations, many of whom—according to neighbors—consume substances and alcohol in public .
> 
> Witnesses report a fight prior to the discovery
> According to accounts collected by El Heraldo, the woman died after a fight broke out between several people gathered in the park. After her death, she was abandoned at the scene , with no medical assistance requested or immediate notification of authorities.
> 
> " They covered the body with a blanket and left," said a resident of the area. Shortly after, neighbors reported the incident to emergency services, which led to the arrival of officers from the Secretariat of Citizen Security (SSC) , who cordoned off the area .
> 
> What has most outraged local residents is the exact location where the body was found : less than 20 meters from an elementary school, with a preschool and daycare nearby. "Children walk here every day, and they didn't even respect that," lamented one mother.
> 
> Prosecutor's Office investigates possible hate crime
> Personnel from the Institute of Forensic Services and Sciences (INCIFO) removed the body. Meanwhile, the Mexico City Prosecutor's Office opened an investigation to clarify what happened. Although the main hypothesis points to a fight, LGBT+ rights organizations are demanding that a hate crime not be ruled out .
> 
> Residents of 507th, 508th, and 509th Streets say the area used to be peaceful, but for months it has become a gathering place for homeless people, many of whom have addiction problems . The parks and median strips have become makeshift shelters where conflicts, drug use , and assaults frequently occur .
> 
> “It seems like no one is taking care of these spaces. What happened shouldn't have happened, much less in front of a school ,” said a resident of the neighborhood who has lived there for more than 20 years.
> 
> The victim has not yet been officially identified. Transgender groups have begun mobilizing to demand justice and immediate clarification of the case. The death of this trans woman, in a children's playground in the heart of an urban center, adds to a disturbing list of systematic violence against the LGBT+ community in Mexico .
