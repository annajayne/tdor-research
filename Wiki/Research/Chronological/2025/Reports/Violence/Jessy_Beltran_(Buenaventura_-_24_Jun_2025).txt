Ciudadela San Antonio
Buenaventura
Colombia
murdered


> June 24, 2025. On Tuesday afternoon, a trans woman was murdered in the Ciudadela San Antonio neighborhood, Phase 1, in Buenaventura. The victim was identified as Jessy BeltrÃ¡n, a young woman recognized for her activism on social media and her presence in community spaces in the city.
> 
> The events, which occurred just minutes ago, are still being investigated. According to preliminary information, authorities arrived at the scene after receiving a report of a dead body, but no details are yet known about the circumstances of the crime or who may be responsible.
> 
> This new case adds to the worrying number of homicides against trans people in Colombia in 2025, amid rising violence and stigmatization of the LGBTIQ+ population, especially in areas with high levels of conflict and the absence of a state. According to data from the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory, this is the 45th case recorded in Colombia.
> 
> The State must guarantee justice and implement urgent measures to protect trans women, particularly in areas like Buenaventura where being diverse is a constant risk. An official statement from the Police and the Prosecutor's Office is still expected in the coming hours; however, in light of this situation, the organization reminds authorities of their obligation to apply the guidelines established in Directive 006 of 2023 of the Attorney General's Office, which orders prosecutors to adopt measures to diligently investigate acts of violence motivated by prejudice against LGBTIQ+ people with enhanced due diligence. This directive also requires that the hypothesis of a hate crime be considered from the outset.
> 
> Caribe Afirmativo strongly rejects these events and hopes for a swift investigation and a prompt clarification of the facts.
