> 
> One person is dead following a shooting in Milwaukee on Friday morning. Feb. 21.

> "Live in the truth y’all," said Dior’s mother, Perriona Williams. "I just want to tell everybody to live in the truth. It doesn’t matter who you are, just open up, be an open book, so your family can know who you are and be able to love you for who you are."

> Loved ones say Dior loved to dance and sing. But most of all, she was herself.
> 
> "We just need some type of understanding, of closure," Jenkins said. "We just want all trans [people] to stay safe. Know that you are loved."
