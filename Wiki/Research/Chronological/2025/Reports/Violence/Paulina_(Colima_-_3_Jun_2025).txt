shot


> COLIMA.- On the night of June 3, Paulina, a trans woman, was shot to death while working at a food establishment in the city of Colima , according to El Heraldo de México.
> 
> According to official reports, armed men shot her at least 10 times outside the "Pozole Luisa" business on Balbino Dávalos Street. Although emergency crews arrived at the scene, Paulina was no longer showing any vital signs . The attackers fled the scene and their identities remain unknown.
> 
> The State Attorney General's Office and municipal police cordoned off the area to begin an investigation. Authorities are analyzing whether this was a hate crime based on her gender identity or whether there were prior threats against her .
> 
> The community demands justice and protection
> This crime revives concerns about violence against the LGBTTIQ+ community in Mexico. In 2023, activists had already warned about the increase in murders of trans people and demanded that the government implement protective mechanisms in labor, social, and security matters.
> 
> Human rights defender Marco Antonio Pérez Gaspar revealed that at least two trans women from Colima had attempted to seek asylum in the United States for fear of violence in Mexico . This case reflects the systematic lack of protection that trans people face in the country.
> 
> Transfemicide? The fight for legal recognition
> Paulina's murder could be classified as transfeminicide , a crime motivated by discrimination and misogyny toward trans women. Although these cases are investigated as femicides in Colima and at the federal level , the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) has called for gender identities to be recognized in laws to create effective public policies against violence.
> 
> Activists point out that transvestite, transgender, and transsexual people face high levels of stigmatization , not only from society but also from public officials who perpetuate discrimination in their positions.

Will there be justice for Paulina?
While authorities investigate, civil society organizations are demanding an immediate government response to prevent further hate crimes . Paulina's death is not an isolated case: it is part of a wave of violence that seeks to obscure the trans community.

The question now is whether the judicial system will act with due diligence or, as in many other cases, will go unpunished.
