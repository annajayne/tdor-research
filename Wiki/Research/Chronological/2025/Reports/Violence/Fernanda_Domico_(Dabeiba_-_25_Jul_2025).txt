stabbed


> July 25, 2025. In recent hours, the body of Fernanda Domicó, a renowned social leader, indigenous trans woman, and head of the Volunteer Fire Department of the municipality of Dabeiba, in western Antioquia, was discovered. The circumstances surrounding her death have not yet been clarified, but they have already generated profound shock both in the municipality and at the regional level, where Fernanda was widely recognized for her commitment to the defense of human rights, the protection of life, and the protection of LGBTI people in community settings.
> 
> This incident, which has brought grief to LGBTIQ+ people in Urabá, cannot be treated as an isolated incident. Rather, it is part of a structural pattern of systematic violence against trans women and sex workers, who face differentiated risks marked by social exclusion, stigmatization, poverty, and the lack of institutional guarantees for the full exercise of their rights.
> 
> This murder adds to a long list of incidents. The Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory records 50 cases in 2025. A discouraging figure that exposes the rise in violence against trans people in Colombia, as announced at the IACHR hearing on violence in the country. 
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo, we demand that the Attorney General's Office and the Barranquilla Metropolitan Police conduct a thorough investigation with a differentiated approach, applying the Protocol for the Investigation of Murders of LGBTI+ People and considering the hypothesis of a hate crime. Furthermore, we demand that the investigation include specific protocols that recognize her gender identity, ethnic origin, and role as a human rights defender.
> 
> We urge local authorities to activate care, protection, and support channels for transgender people and sex workers at risk, ensuring compliance with institutional commitments regarding human rights and non-discrimination. We call on the media to report on this case responsibly, avoiding re-victimizing or stigmatizing approaches, and to recognize the victim's gender identity in accordance with the principles of respect, dignity, and a meaningful name.
> 
> We remind the Colombian State of its international obligation to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress violence based on prejudice, in compliance with the standards established by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and other international human rights organizations.
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo, we demand guarantees of non-repetition for LGBTI people in rural and ethnic territories, as well as the effective implementation of collective protection measures for diverse leaders. Her death cannot go unpunished or be forgotten.
> 
> Justice for Fernanda. Her voice remains a flame of dignity.




> Fernanda Domicó, a trans woman and head of the Dabeiba Fire Department, was murdered.
> The Antioquia Governor's Office is offering a $20 million reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible.
