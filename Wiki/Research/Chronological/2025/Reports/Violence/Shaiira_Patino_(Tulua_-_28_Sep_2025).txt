shot


> Violence rocked the municipality of Tuluá again early Sunday morning, when a trans woman, identified as Shaira Patiño , was shot at on Carrera 40 and Calle 17, just a few meters from the Morales River and a well-known restaurant.
> 
> According to preliminary reports, the victim was approached by armed men who shot her repeatedly, leaving her seriously injured. Patiño was immediately taken to a medical center, where doctors confirmed she was brain dead .
> 
> His death was officially announced in recent hours, causing great shock among family, friends, and the municipality's diverse community.
> 
> The Valle del Cauca Police and the Attorney General's Office are conducting investigations to clarify the motives for the attack and capture those responsible.
> 
> So far, no official theories about the attack have been revealed. However, several users on social media have speculated that it could be linked to violence against the LGBTIQ+ population.



> At the same time, we denounce with alarm the increase in lethal violence against LGBTIQ+ people in the department. Last Friday, in Cali, Samantha, a trans woman recognized for her work as a stylist at Francheska hair salon, was murdered. That same day, in the municipality of Tuluá, violence was repeated against Shaira Patiño, also a trans woman, who was the victim of an armed attack: she was shot and died in a health center.
