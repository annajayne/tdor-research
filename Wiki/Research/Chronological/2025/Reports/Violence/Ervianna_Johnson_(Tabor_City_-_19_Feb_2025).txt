homicide



> The homicide of a 25 year old Black trans woman in Tabor, North Carolina on February 19, 2025 came to light after an exhaustive search when her family reported her missing six days prior. Her name was Ervianna “Baydee” Johnson.
> 
> Note: some media, law enforcement, and family members refer to Ervianna by her assigned name and gender.
> 
> The Crime
> According to BlaqueOut magazine. Ervianna left her home without her phone, keys or belongings at 3:00AM on February 13. This gave her family reason to think she would be back quickly. She did not return so her family began to search for her. On February 16, they filed a missing persons report. Family found Ervianna’s body on Wednesday, Feb 19, 2025. Her body was found near a pond to the south of where she had lived on Bermuda Bay Lane. She was discovered face down without shoes.
> 
> On February 26, police announced that her death was a homicide. The Columbus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) is working with the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation They are awaiting final autopsy results.
> 
> No suspect has been identified.
> 
> Anyone with information about Ervianna is asked to call 910.640.1428.
> 
> Honoring Ervianna
> Ervianna lived in Tabor City, North Carolina with family. She turned 25 in September. According to her social media, she worked as a digital content creator and at LaQuinta Inn & Suites.
> 
> Her social media content suggests she liked to dance, she was creative, brave, and bold. One thing about social media is that she gets to tell her own story – in images, video, memes, words, all of it. She created the unique story of her life. She repeatedly stated that she wanted to go viral. We could try to make that happen as a tribute to her life versus the story of her death alone.
> 
> She liked GloRilla, Rupaul’s Drag Race, and hip-hop majorette competitions. I was definitely impressed with her drop split.
> 
> Most of all, Ervianna’s family fills her social media, especially her nephews and nieces. She celebrated their birthdays, went to their events, and boasted about them. Clearly, she adored them. One of her final videos was celebrating an unexpected snowfall giving her a chance to have a snowball fight with them.
> 
> She was vibrant in so many ways. It is heartrending that those children will grow up without her. It is tragic she won’t grow up.
> 
> The Context
> Ervianna is the fourth trans person whose death has been reported in 2025. She is the third trans woman, the third Black trans woman, and the fourth Black transgender person on our list.
> 
> All of the people on our list for this year are Black trans folx. Not most of them, not the majority – all of them.
> 
> In 2024, we reported on the death of Quanesha Shantel  age 26. In 2023, North Carolina lost two trans folx – KC Johnson and Jacob Williamson. Sasha Mason  was killed in 2022. In 2021, three folx were killed Jenna Franks Jaida Peterson and Remy Fennell,
> 
> This young woman deserved better. How does her family cope with the loss, especially since they found her? How do you get past such a tragedy? Now they wait for the autopsy, they wait for an investigation, they wait for justice.




> The death of a missing person whose body was found east of Tabor City last week is being investigated as a homicide, according to the N.C. State Bureau of Investigation.
> 
> “Preliminary autopsy results from the NC Medical Examiner’s Office revealed that the death of Ervin Johnson was caused by homicide,” the SBI stated in a Wednesday morning press release.
> 
> Johnson, who also went by the names “Baydee” and “Ervianna,” was found dead Feb. 19 near their home on Bermuda Bay Lane off of Clyde Norris Road.
> 
> Johnson was last seen walking outside at approximately 3 a.m. on Feb. 13 "without any belongings, as if meeting someone briefly,” the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office said in a Feb. 18 missing person’s notice. “Johnson's mother was the last person to see or speak to Johnson before leaving. All personal items, including a phone, ID card, and bank cards, were left behind."
> 
> At the scene where the body was discovered on Feb. 19, Jolene Johnson identified herself to The News Reporter as Ervianna Johnson’s sister.
> 
> According to Jolene Johnson, Ervianna Johnson’s body was found lying facedown near a pond with no shoes. She said a phone was found near Ervianna Johnson’s body, but she didn’t believe it was her sibling’s phone.
> 
> A CCSO incident report filed Feb. 16 provides a description of a potential “offender/suspect” connected to the case: a 21-year-old Black male, standing approximately 5 feet 10 inches and weighing about 180 pounds. The person was not named in the version of the report provided to the media through a standing public records request.
> 
> “The SBI and Columbus County Sheriff’s Office are seeking any information that the public may have with respect to this crime. If you have any information, please call the SBI at 910-939-6200 or the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office at 910-642-6551,” the SBI’s Wednesday release said.
