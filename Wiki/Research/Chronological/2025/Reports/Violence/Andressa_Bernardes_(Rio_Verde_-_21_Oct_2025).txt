> A 43-year-old trans woman, who identified herself as Andressa Bernardes and whose birth certificate was Rede Wagner Faria Bernardes, was brutally murdered in Rio Verde, southwestern Goiás. The shocking crime occurred on Monday night (20), in the Monte Sinai neighborhood. According to the Civil Police, after getting involved in a fight at a bar, she was chased, forced into a car, and taken to a remote location, where she was strangled, stoned, and beaten with bottles. To make matters worse, part of her body was also burned.
> 
> Police Chief Adelson Candeo, in charge of the case, explained that the altercation began at a nightclub in Bairro Popular. "They were at the club with a call girl, and a fight broke out. The transvestite threw a drink at the girl and ran off, taking one of the men's phone. Then they went after her, three men and the call girl, put the victim in the car, and had the unfortunate idea of ??taking her to a secluded location to commit this atrocity. It was a silly incident, a fight, and then a cell phone theft that ended like this," he stated.
> 
> Four suspects were arrested by the Civil Police and Military Police less than eight hours after the crime. Three of them, employees of an air conditioning company, were found in a supermarket in the city, where they were working in maintenance. The fourth person arrested is a woman identified as a call girl who was present at the scene of the altercation. The defendants' defenses chose not to comment on the case.
> 
> During the investigation, sheets with traces of blood were found inside the vehicle used in the crime, a white Ford KA. The four suspects were taken to the Rio Verde Civil Police Station and may be charged with aggravated homicide.
> 
> Andressa Bernardes was the sister of Rio Verde lawyer Romeu Carlos Faria Bernardes. Her death mobilized several organizations in the city, including the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB), Rio Verde chapter, which issued a statement of condolence in solidarity with her family and friends. Andressa's body was laid to rest at the Pax Maurilândia Chapel in Maurilândia and buried in the city's Municipal Cemetery, attended by family and friends in a deeply sad atmosphere.
> 
> The case continues to be investigated by the 8th Regional Police Station of Rio Verde. Violence against trans people is a serious and recurring problem that needs to be addressed by society as a whole. It is crucial that cases like this are not forgotten and that justice is achieved for the victims and their families. Join the movement for respect and equality, and say no to violence and discrimination.
