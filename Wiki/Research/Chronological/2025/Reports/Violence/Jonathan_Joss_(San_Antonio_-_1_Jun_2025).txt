> Police Walk Back Claim That Jonathan Joss’ Murder Was Not a Hate Crime
> This story contains descriptions of violence against a Native LGBTQ+ person.
> 
> San Antonio police are walking back a past claim that there was no evidence suggesting actor Jonathan Joss’ murder was a homophobic hate crime.
> 
> Joss, known for roles on King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation, was fatally shot last Sunday, June 1. The San Antonio Police Department arrested Joss’ neighbor, Sigfredo Alvarez Ceja, that same day and charged him with first-degree murder. The late actor’s husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales posted to Facebook the following day alleging that the fatal shooting was a homophobic hate crime that occurred while the couple were checking the mail at their former home.
> 
> In a June 2 statement shared on social media, however, police stated that “despite online claims of this being a hate crime, currently the investigation has found no evidence to indicate that the Mr. Joss’s murder was related to his sexual orientation.”
> 
> But during a June 5 press conference, SAPD Chief William P. McManus acknowledged that “it was too early in the process for any statement of that nature to be issued.”
> 
> “We understand that many in the LGBTQ+ community are feeling anxious and concerned,” McManus continued. “A lot of it has to do with that premature statement that we released, and again, I own that. Shouldn’t have done it.”
> 
> McManus clarified that Ceja has not been charged with a hate crime yet because, in Texas, hate crimes are not treated as separate charges but are addressed through sentencing enhancements. He added that the SAPD is currently working with the San Antonio Fire Department’s arson investigators “to better understand the fire connected to this case” that occurred in January.
> 
> In Kern de Gonzales’ June 2 Facebook post, which was shared to Joss’ account, he wrote that the fatal shooting occurred while the couple were checking mail at their former home, which he said was burned down two years into an “openly homophobic” harassment campaign. (In June 3 comments to The Independent, Kern de Gonzales confirmed that he is also transgender).
> 
> Kern de Gonzales further claimed that, despite the couple reporting these threats to police multiple times, law enforcement took no further action. During McManus’ public statement, he confirmed that the SAPD had received approximately 70 calls over the past two years from both Joss and his neighbors regarding “various neighborhood-type disturbances.”
> 
> According to Kern de Gonzales, he and Joss saw the skull of one of their dogs who had been killed in the fire and its harness placed nearby the site of their former home, causing them both “severe emotional distress.” A man alleged to be Ceja approached the couple, Kern de Gonzales wrote, and began yelling “violent homophobic slurs” at them before raising a gun and firing.
> 
> “Jonathan and I had no weapons,” Kern de Gonzales continued in his Facebook post. “We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired, Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.”
> 
> A March 2025 report from the Human Rights Campaign found that LGBTQ+ and Two-Spirit Indigenous people face disproportionately high rates of violence. Meanwhile, according to The Guardian, a 2021 report released by the Sovereign Bodies Institute and the California Rural Indian Health Board states that of 18 respondents who identified as Native LGBTQ2, nearly 90% reported having experienced two or more forms of violence.
> 
> On Thursday, the SAPD and Pride San Antonio hosted a community forum regarding Joss’ murder. According to local outlet KSAT, one attendee said that following her gay brother’s murder in February 2023, she has had “such a hard time with SAPD” trying to solve her brother’s case.
> 
> “Before, I would have just thought you call the police when you have a problem,” Heidi, another attendee, said. “Now I think I’d be a bit more nervous for them after hearing the stories.”






> The husband of Jonathan Joss, the “King of the Hill” actor fatally shot by a neighbor in San Antonio, thanked Joss for saving his life in the Sunday altercation. He explained that the actor, whom he had just married on Valentine’s Day, pushed him out of the line of fire at the site of their former home, which had burned down following repeated threats.
> 
> “[The neighbor] started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired. Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side-by-side. When the man fired, Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life,” Tristan Kern de Gonzales wrote in a Facebook post on Monday.
> 
> Joss’ neighbor, identified as Sigfredo Alvarez-Cega, was arrested a block away. Alvarez-Cega, who reportedly got into a heated argument with Joss before killing him, has been charged with murder.

> De Gonzales explained that before the neighbor with the gun appeared, they were horrified to discover “the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw,” he said.
> 
> “He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other. I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved,” de Gonzales wrote.
> 
> He also explained that during the two years he and Joss had lived at the site, that “people in the area … repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.”
> 
> He added that they were “harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship” from people who were “openly homophobic.” De Gonzales said that he and Joss were still newlyweds who were looking for a trailer and “planning our future.”
> 
> He thanked Joss’ friends and fans, concluding his post with, “My focus now is on protecting Jonathan’s legacy and honoring the life we built together … Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.”



> Jonathan Joss’ husband reveals King of the Hill actor’s final moments and repeats ‘hate crime’ claim
> In the moments after King of the Hill and Parks and Recreation actor Jonathan Joss was fatally gunned down Sunday night, his husband claims the accused killer cackled as the 59-year-old lay dying.
> 
> "Everything was really close range. It was in the head," Tristan Kern de Gonzales told The Independent. "I held his face together while I told him how much I loved him. He could still hear me, he looked up at me and he wasn't able to talk because of the extent [of his injuries], but I could tell he was trying to say, 'I love you.'"
> 
> Suspect Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez was arrested a block away from the scene of the shooting and is now facing first-degree murder charges. Kern de Gonzales said Joss' death was the result of anti-LGBT+ sentiment aimed at the doomed couple. However, police in San Antonio, Texas, say there is "no evidence" the killing was motivated by bigotry.
> 
> "While I'm holding him, he has the gun pointed over me, and he's laughing, saying, 'Oh, you love him? Joto,'" Kern de Gonzales alleged. "'Joto' is Spanish for f****t. I never knew the word until I came to Texas, and then I heard it a lot.
> 
> Joss was pronounced dead at the scene. Ceja, according to an incident report obtained from the San Antonio Police Department, immediately confessed to the murder, telling officers, "I shot him."
> 
> The SAPD quickly dismissed the shooting as a potential hate crime, issuing a statement on Monday that claimed investigators had “found no evidence to indicate that… Mr. Joss' murder was related to his sexual orientation.”
> 
> “We take such allegations very seriously and have thoroughly reviewed all available information,” the statement said. “Should any new evidence come to light, we will charge the suspect accordingly.”
> 
> The deadly incident followed years of feuding between Joss, Kern de Gonzales, and the suspect, according to Kern de Gonzales, who grew up in South Carolina. He said they came home to find the skull of one of their dogs, which had been killed when their house burned down this winter, on display near their mailbox, deeply upsetting the two of them. (There is no mention of this incident in the SAPD incident report.)
> 
> Joss began screaming, and this led to the eventual confrontation with the suspect, said Kern de Gonzales. In a Facebook post announcing Joss’ death, Kern de Gonzales alleged the shooter shouted “violent homophobic slurs” at the two of them before opening fire.
> 
> Kern de Gonzales, who described himself as a transgender man, pushed back forcefully against the SAPD’s assertion that their background didn’t play a part in the killing.
> 
> “They ignored us, refused to file police reports for about two years [over the couple’s complaints of harassment], and now they’re trying to say it wasn't a hate crime,” Kern de Gonzales told The Independent. “It’s like when the police investigate themselves and find they did nothing wrong.”

> Over the past 36 hours, local residents have recounted tales of Joss having been, alternately, “really sweet,” then at times wandering down the street “ranting and raving.” One called Joss “erratic,” and claimed he told people that “he was God.” Another neighbor shared a video with local CBS affiliate KENS, purportedly showing Joss walking back and forth with a pitchfork, screaming.
> 
> The SAPD said it responded to more than 40 calls involving Joss in 2024, ranging from welfare checks, mental health issues, and dust-ups with neighbors. However, according to Kern de Gonzales, who married Joss this past Valentine’s Day, the actor may have been loud but he was never violent.
> 
> “I don't care if me and my husband were walking around with one pitchfork in our hand and another pitchfork up our a**, we didn't point any weapons at anybody,” Kern de Gonzales told The Independent. “When the man rolled up with the gun, we were checking the mail.”
> 
> He said he found it “really sad how people treat other people when they're having a mental health crisis or going through trauma,” and that no one wants to consider what led to that point.
> 
> “It's OK to be a little sad, but if you’re in a state where you’re yelling or whatever, that doesn't get the same grace,” Kern de Gonzales said.
> 
> 
> 
> Jonathan Joss never threatened anyone, even if he sometimes suffered mental health episodes, husband Tristan Kern de Gonzales told The Independent (Facebook)
> According to Kern de Gonzales, Joss, who has Native American heritage, had long been subjected to racist verbal attacks.
> 
> “I had never seen someone be accosted for being Native American,” Kern de Gonzales said. “He would be playing the drum a lot outside, singing, chanting, praying… People would drive by and yell out the window, ‘F***ng Indian,’ and it’s just like, what kind of point are you trying to make?
> 
> Then, when Kern de Gonzales moved in, he said “the homophobia started.”
> 
> “Jonathan would be harassed for just being in his yard wearing a dress,” Kern de Gonzales went on. “When people would ask why he wore a dress, he would say, ‘Because I have nice legs.’ And he did. He looked beautiful in a dress. And I think a lot of people were threatened by that, because Jonathan could wear a dress and still be masculine and confident.”
> 
> The two coped using humor, and “always found something at the end of the day to laugh about,” Kern de Gonzales explained. As he now prepares his husband’s funeral, people have inquired about his plans for the body, whether Joss wanted to be buried or cremated.
> 
> “I do take joy in quoting Jonathan, which is actually paraphrasing a line from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” Kern de Gonzales said. “He used to love to tell people, ‘When I die, I don’t care what you do with me. Cut me up and make a soup out of me, I don’t care.’ It makes me laugh now because I know Jonathan’s laughing too.”
