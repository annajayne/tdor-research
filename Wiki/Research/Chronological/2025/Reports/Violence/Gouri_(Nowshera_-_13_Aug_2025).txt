> While we were celebrating Independence Day, we received heartbreaking news and mourn for our community.
> 
> A transgender persons from Sindh sakhar, Gouri, was shot yesterday and murdered in her own room at Nowshera Shama Chowk Plaza.
> 
> Manzil Foundationâ€™s Executive Director, Madam Arzoo Khan, strongly condemns this brutal killing, stating: Inhumane behavior towards the transgender community continues in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and across Pakistan. In 2025 alone, eight transgender persons have been brutally murdered. Transgender community is not safe anywhere, not at Functions, not outside, and not even in the privacy of their own Dheras/houses.
> 
> We urge the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to immediately lodge an FIR and take serious, urgent measures to stop the systematic violence against the transgender community.
