> A Chinese male suspect said he killed a Thai transwoman in Pattaya because she refused to have sex with him, and then he cut open her body and removed organs because he wanted to "play" with it.
> 
> According to police, Fu Tongyung, 42, confessed to slaying Woranan Pannacha, a 25-year-old transwoman who was a native of Nong Khai province.
> 
> He was quoted as saying through a translator that he met Woranan near South Pattaya beach Friday evening and exchanged WeChat application contacts with her. At that time, he thought Woranan was a woman by birth.
> 
> At about 9pm Friday, Woranan contacted him. They met at his rented room and agreed to have sex for 8,000 baht.
> 
> The Chinese man said that Woranan later refused to have sex with him, so he demanded a 50% refund.
> 
> As she did not give the partial refund, the two quarrelled and fought. The woman scratched his face and kicked him off his bed. He then got back on the bed, sat on her body and strangled her.
> 
> He dragged her body to a toilet room, used scissors to cut open her breasts and pulled out silicone implants.
> 
> Then he felt like he wanted to “play” with the body. So, he used the scissors to cut open the body from the neck to the genitals and took out the heart, he told police.
> 
> Afterwards, he washed the body and himself, went to bed, slept, woke up in the morning, reserved a flight and travelled to Suvarnabhumi airport to return to China. He was arrested at the airport in Samut Prakan province on Saturday.
> 
> The Chinese man said he did not know if he was mentally ill because he had never sought a diagnosis. He said he could not control himself after the victim attacked him. He was a welder in China and had paid three visits to Thailand.
> 
> On his first visit, he travelled in a tour group but for the last two visits, he visited the country alone. He said he did nothing with the lungs of the victim, which were missing from the body. He apologised for the crime.
> 
> Pattaya police chief Pol Col Anek Sathongyu said the suspect confessed amid strong evidence proved he had committed the crime. The chief said that the lungs of the victim went missing but the bag that the suspect carried contained only a drinking bottle, not an organ.
