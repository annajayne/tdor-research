> Today we woke up with a lot of anger and pain. Today, violence hits closer to home. It pains us to record the murder of Nawar Jiménez, who always belonged to us in El Carmen de Bolívar. Her murder is deeply painful and brings grief to our team.



> The Bolívar and San Andrés Territorial Directorate of the Victims Unit expressed its strong condemnation and deep regret for the murder of Nawar Jiménez, a renowned social leader, defender of the rights of LGBTIQ+ people, and victim of the armed conflict. 
> 
> The body of Nawar Jiménez was found dead at the roundabout connecting the municipalities of El Carmen de Bolívar and San Jacinto.
> 
> Nawar was part of the LGBTIQ+ collective reparation program in the municipality of El Carmen de Bolívar. 
> 
> "Nawar Jiménez's life represents an example of resilience, dignity, and commitment to social transformation in the Montes de María region. Her murder constitutes a grave violation of her integrity, but also of the community processes of memory, justice, and reparation that, for years, have bravely confronted institutional neglect and multiple forms of structural violence," the Victims' Unit states.
> 
> Nawar Jiménez actively participated in the most recent march of the It's Not Time to Be Silent campaign, where more than 500 women marched from the municipality of Ovejas to the town of Flor del Monte.
> murder of an LGBTIQ leader
> 
> "The body, found face down in a ditch, is evidence of the violence with which her life was taken," police said.
> 
> The case has generated shock among social organizations and human rights defenders, who warn that this crime is not an isolated incident. It represents, once again, the risks faced by those, like Nawar, who speak out for equality, recognition, and the free expression of diverse identities in a country where discrimination and prejudice-based violence still persist.
> 
> "We deeply regret this irreparable loss. Nawar was a peacemaker and a fundamental voice in the defense of human rights. Her life symbolized the collective strength of those who have decided to turn pain into a force for change. Her absence leaves a void in one of the most significant collective reparation processes in the country," the organization added.
> 
> The authorities issued an urgent and categorical call to national, departmental, and municipal entities, as well as to civil society, to structurally and immediately review the protection and prevention measures aimed at safeguarding the lives and integrity of people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.
> 
> "Nawar Jiménez's memory calls us to demand justice, to ensure non-repetition, and to act decisively in the face of this crisis of violence motivated by prejudice. His legacy cannot be forgotten, nor his struggle snuffed out," adds the Victims Unit.
> 
> Nawar deserves justice, and the Colombian state has an obligation to offer much more than condolences. "It must guarantee a dignified and safe life for all people who defend the rights of all people," the entity concludes.
