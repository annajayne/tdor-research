> September 22, 2025. In the early hours of September 22, 2025, a new act of violence erupted, saddening Colombia's diverse population. Karen, known by the community as "Mariana" or "La Jassan," a trans woman, was murdered in the La Esmeralda neighborhood of Popayán, amid a firefight during a police operation.
> 
> According to the facts, the victim was not involved in the confrontation, but was caught in the middle of it, being shot by National Police officers who, according to witnesses, failed to apply the civil protection protocols that should govern these procedures.
> 
> This case becomes the 55th recorded by the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory in 2025, and the second this year in which a trans person has died as a result of violent actions carried out by law enforcement officers. This highlights the serious risk faced by people with trans life experience in contexts of institutional violence.
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo, we make an urgent call to citizens and civil society organizations to speak out against these acts that threaten the lives of diverse, innocent people, whose only "crime" has been to be in the midst of scenes of violence that institutions should prevent.
> 
> Likewise, we urge the Attorney General's Office to conduct a rigorous criminal investigation with a differentiated approach that will clarify the facts and bring those responsible to justice; the Attorney General's Office to immediately initiate disciplinary proceedings against the officers involved and punish them in an exemplary manner; and the Ombudsman's Office to guarantee comprehensive support for the families and the diverse population of Popayán, who today feel threatened. 
> 
> Karen's memory demands justice and respect. Colombian society cannot remain indifferent to the systematic violence faced by trans people, who daily demand dignity, recognition, and full citizenship guarantees.
> 
> At Caribe Afirmativo, we categorically reject these acts of institutional violence that are currently causing mourning for the transgender population in Popayán. We express our deep concern over the disproportionate use of force by the National Police and demand that an investigation be carried out with a human rights and gender perspective, which will not only clarify what happened but also provide justice and reparation to the victims.

> 
> Despite the cold night in Payanes, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and loved ones of La Hassan, or Karen, the trans woman who died after being caught in the crossfire, gathered to pay tribute to her at the site of the tragedy: the El Cadillal neighborhood.
> 
> She deserved it, for that gigantic heart she had and the powerful joy she radiated every time she walked the streets of this sector of the capital of Cauca, and as her friends and confidants clearly confirmed, they do not accept that a gunshot, apparently fired by a police officer, ended her life in the early hours of Monday, September 22.
> 
> Those who attended this event urged the Prosecutor's Office to expedite the investigation and impose exemplary punishment on the person responsible for this violent act.
> 
> “Karen was a very special person to Carlos and I, especially in the last month, when we were very attentive to her, giving her a lot of love and receiving the same from her, so now facing her departure is something that hits us very hard. I shared a lot of time with this wonderful person. I met him more than twenty years ago, when he became my stylist at a hair salon in the Santa Clara neighborhood,” said Carol Chacón, who participated in this candlelight vigil.
> 
> For this reason, and after the Forensic Medicine officials released the body of this trans woman, her friends and colleagues did not hesitate to express the pain they now feel after the death of this person who made the streets her space for happiness, even in the face of violence and intolerance.
> 
> "Here we are, my Hassan, the people of the Los Sin Techo humanitarian camp, because you often accompanied us in our mobilizations, with that joy you shared with others and the energy of your heart. That's why tonight is not just any night, because today the angel that you were in the lives of many people departs for heaven," expressed leaders of this social group.
> 
> The death of this citizen is currently under investigation after a video emerged showing Karen lying on a sidewalk at 4th Street and Highway 17 after being shot. Who did it? That is the question the Prosecutor's Office will have to answer, despite witness accounts and other evidence available about this violent incident.
> 
> Meanwhile, members of the Popayán Metropolitan Police confirmed that in the early hours of Monday, September 22, a procedure was carried out in the La Esmeralda sector , where a surveillance patrol was pursuing an armed man.
> 
> According to the official report, shots were fired during the chase, leaving the alleged assailant wounded but later captured. However, Karen , a well-known member of the city's LGBTIQ+ and Puma communities , was also fatally injured at the scene. She sadly died minutes later at the medical center where she was taken.
> 
> For this reason, Colonel Germán Alfonso Manrique Cornejo, commander of the Metropolitan Police of Popayán , confirmed that the institution regrets what happened and offered support to the family and the affected communities, while an investigation was initiated into the uniformed officers accused of participating in this incident.
> 
> "We express our condolences and offer institutional support to clearly determine the circumstances that led to this unfortunate incident," the official added.
> 
> Meanwhile, Daniel Gallego, one of the leaders of the LGBTIQ+ community in the capital of Cauca, openly blamed the police for causing the death of this trans woman, who was widely known in the city for.
> 
> “Today, the LGBTIQ+ population of the Cauca department and the city of Popayán woke up to the terrible news of the murder of our comrade known as La Hassan, by her feminine name Karen, a trans woman living in the Esmeralda sector. She was hit by gunfire, which is presumed to have been fired by public forces, in this case by a police officer,” added Daniel Gallego.
> 
> While the investigation progresses, tributes to this trans woman continue, and as a sign of mourning, members of this community and other citizens lit candles in the area where the victim used to stay.
