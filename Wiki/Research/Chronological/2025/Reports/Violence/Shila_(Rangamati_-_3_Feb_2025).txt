> Press & Public Statement: JMBF Strongly Condemns the Heinous Murder of Transgender Activist Shila in Rangamati: Calls for Immediate Justice and Legal Reforms
> 
> (বাংলায় বিবৃতিটি পড়তে, অনুগ্রহপূর্বক ইংরেজি ভার্ষণের শেষে দেখুন) Paris, France | February 06, 2025: France-based hulan rights organization, JusticeMakers Bangladesh in France (JMBF) is deeply concerned and outraged by the barbaric and targeted murder of transgender activist Shila, who was brutally killed in her home in Betbunia, Rangamati district, on February 3, 2025. Shila was a courageous advocate for transgender rights, a champion of social justice, and a beacon of hope for marginalized transgender communities in Bangladesh. Her horrific murder—marked by extreme violence and a clear intent to silence her voice—is a gross violation of human rights and demands immediate and uncompromising action.
> JMBF unequivocally condemns this cowardly and premeditated act of terror, which not only took the life of a fearless activist but also sent a chilling message to the entire transgender and LGBT+ community. This crime underscores the deep-rooted discrimination, systemic violence, and impunity that sexual minorities continue to face in Bangladesh due to social stigma, legal barriers, and state negligence.
> 
> Fact in Brief  (Based on information received from JMBF's reliable sources and news reports from various media outlets in Bangladesh):
> 
> Transgender activist Shila was brutally murdered in her home in Betbunia, under the jurisdiction of Betbunia Police Station in Rangamati district, in the early hours of February 3, 2025. Police recovered her body later that evening, confirming a gruesome and targeted attack. Shila’s lifeless body was found with her throat brutally slashed and decapitated, suggesting the involvement of militants. Her tragic killing has sparked outrage and heightened concerns for the safety of marginalized communities in the region.
> Shila, originally from Hathazari Police Station in Chattogram district, was a prominent advocate for the transgender community. She was widely recognized for her humanitarian work and unwavering commitment to social justice. Her untimely and violent death has sent shockwaves through the community, raising urgent questions about the safety of transgender individuals in Bangladesh.
> 
> According to local sources, five unidentified individuals were seen entering Shila’s home around 11:00 PM on February 2, 2025. When attempts to contact her the following day went unanswered, a fellow transgender individual alerted neighbors. Upon entering the house, they discovered Shila’s body with her throat violently slit and additional stab wounds to her abdomen.
> 
> Kaukhali Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Md. Saiful Islam Sohag condemned the crime, calling it an act of extreme violence. “This was a brutal and premeditated attack. We have gathered crucial evidence from the crime scene and are actively pursuing all leads. The body has been sent for post-mortem examination,” he confirmed.
> 
> Robert Simon, a prominent French LGBT rights activist, and Chief Adviser of expressed his deep outrage, stating:
> 
> "Shila’s murder is not just a tragedy; it is a crime against humanity and an attack on the fundamental rights of transgender individuals. We cannot allow such horrific violence to go unchecked. The world must stand in solidarity to demand justice, and the Bangladesh government must act swiftly to bring the perpetrators to justice. Silence is not an option."
> 
> Advocate Shahanur Islam, a Bangladeshi human rights lawyer and Founder President of JMBF, emphasized the urgent need for legal reforms, stating:
> 
> "This brutal killing highlights the extreme vulnerability of sexual minorities and LGBT+ communities in Bangladesh. Without urgent legal protections, these communities will continue to suffer violence, discrimination, and exclusion. The government must not only bring Shila’s killers to justice but also take immediate steps to repeal Section 377 of the Bangladesh Penal Code, which criminalizes homosexuality, and enact a Sexual Minority Protection Act to ensure the safety, dignity, and equal rights of all LGBT+ individuals. Justice is not only about punishing perpetrators—it’s about preventing such crimes in the first place."
> 
> JMBF Strongly Demands:
> A swift and transparent investigation – The Bangladesh authorities must ensure a thorough and impartial probe into Shila’s murder. All those involved—both the perpetrators and any possible masterminds—must be identified and brought to justice without delay.
> Immediate legal action – The culprits must face the full extent of the law, and the judiciary must act decisively to deliver swift and exemplary punishment to prevent future crimes against transgender and LGBT+ individuals.
> Decriminalization of homosexuality – The Bangladesh government must immediately repeal Section 377 of the Penal Code, which criminalizes same-sex relationships and fuels discrimination against LGBT+ individuals.
> Enactment of a Sexual Minority Protection Act – Bangladesh must urgently pass a legal framework that ensures the protection, rights, and dignity of transgender and LGBT+ individuals, providing them with legal recourse against discrimination, hate crimes, and violence.
> Increased protection for LGBT+ activists and individuals – The government must take urgent steps to guarantee the safety and security of sexual minority communities, who remain among the most vulnerable members of society.
> Shila’s murder is not just an attack on one person—it is an attack on equality, dignity, and the fundamental principles of human rights. The failure to protect LGBT+ individuals in Bangladesh and the continued criminalization of homosexuality embolden those who seek to harm them. Justice delayed is justice denied.
> 
> JMBF calls upon the Bangladesh government, law enforcement agencies, and international human rights organizations to stand in solidarity, demand justice, and ensure that such crimes do not go unpunished. Furthermore, JMBF urges immediate legal reforms to decriminalize homosexuality and legally protect sexual minorities, ensuring that no individual is persecuted for their identity.
> 
> JMBF will closely monitor the development of this violent incident and remains firm in its commitment to fighting for justice, amplifying the voices of the oppressed, and ensuring that no act of violence against transgender and LGBT+ individuals is met with silence.
