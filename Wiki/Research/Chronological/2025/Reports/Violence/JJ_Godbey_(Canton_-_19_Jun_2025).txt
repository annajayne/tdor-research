> Status of missing Canton drag artist JJ Godbey now a homicide investigation with suspect in custody
> July 8, 2025 by Sue
> 
> Last week, we reported on the disappearance of a 26 year old trans drag artist from Canton, Ohio. Sadly, police have now determined this is a homicide investigation.
> 
> Canton police announced late Thursday that the disappearance of JJ Godbey is now a homicide investigation. They’ve charged Daniel Mattay, Ryan’s former boyfriend, with four felonies: murder, felonious assault, strangulation and domestic violence.“New evidence has led our agency to transition the case from a missing person to a homicide investigation,” Canton Police Chief John Gabbard wrote in a news release. “While [JJ] Godbey has not yet been located, the new evidence makes it clear that [they are] deceased and that Mr. Mattay is responsible.”
> 
> I cannot begin to imagine how JJ’s family and friends are coping with these developments, waiting for someone to find them. That’s an ‘in between’ space of such heartbreak.
> 
> Note: There are conflicting reports on how JJ identified. I will default to gender nonconforming (GNC) as a broad category and use they/them pronouns as well as the name JJ Godbey. The tragedy is that this young beautiful soul was robbed of life by someone they trusted, maybe loved. We should honor their identity, of course, but until that becomes more clear – and I don’t know how that could happen – I’m choosing to honor them in this way.
> 
> JJ was born and raised in the Canton, Ohio area. They graduated from Massillon Washington High School in 2017. Their social media lists Mariah Carey and Lady Gaga as favorites along with Pink and Ciara. JJ was also a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Their page lists a wide range of movies they enjoyed.
> 
> JJ was very popular in the regional LGBTQ community – supporting causes and local businesses as well as standing with the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting and supporting transgender rights. JJ was considered an excellent makeup artist, was named to homecoming court in high school and may have been in the band.
> 
> A few weeks before their disappearance, they shared a desire to take sewing lessons to make costumes. Prior to that, they expressed interest in learning how to tend bar.
> 
> JJ gave their first drag performance in September 2024. On their TikTok, they shared a video saying their interest in drag started very early.
> 
> A memorial drag show has been set for Friday, July 11 at Barmacy Bar in Akron, Ohio. I am not aware of any formal crowdfunds so please be careful responding to asks. I’ll update if I find something.
> 
> Rest in power, Jj. Your beautiful and generous spirit changed your community. I am sorry violence stole your life as you just got started.  I hope the overwhelming number of people who came looking for you is a source of comfort. They will always come looking. That’s our promise to you.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.





> CANTON, Ohio — The search for a Canton man, who disappeared under suspicious circumstances, is intensifying.
> 
> While police continue to look for 26-year-old Ryan Godbey, family members and friends have posted between 100 and 200 flyers on trees, telephone poles and various buildings, including Ryan's apartment and the LGBTQ+ nightclub where he was last seen.
> 
> "We need help from the community to find Ryan!" is written on the flyers, which also urge people to contact Canton police if they have any information on the mysterious disappearance.
> "I love him. My mom loves him. Our family loves him. The LGBTQ community loves him. We just want Ryan home," said his mother, Jackie Godbey, as she fought back tears.
> 
> Ryan, who also goes by "JJ", performs as a drag queen, but he didn't show up for a weekend performance that he was excited for, and that was just one of many reasons the family had cause for alarm.
> 
> Judy Jamsion, Ryan's grandmother, said she hardly goes a day without talking to Ryan.
> 
> "Bring him home. I see him every day— talk to him every day— but I don't know where he is. I'm scared," Jamison said.
> 
> Ryan was last seen at "Darlin's Crew" bar on Cherry Avenue NE late on Thursday night, June 19. According to his mother, Ryan sent a text to a friend before 12:30 a.m. Friday. There has been no sign of him since then.
> 
> Not knowing where Ryan is or what could have happened to him is agonizing for his family.
> 
> "Pure hell. That's it. Period. You don't know. You wonder. You're afraid," Jamison said.
> 
> Adding to the fear, Jackie said there appeared to be some sort of struggle inside Ryan's apartment on 17th Street NW.
> 
> "There were definitely signs of a struggle in the apartment when the Canton Police Department did their search. It is, I would say at this point, considered a crime scene," she said.
> 
> Canton police said detectives are "acting with an increased sense of urgency", but they would not answer questions about the case on Tuesday or Wednesday.
> 
> A News 5 crew spotted detectives looking for possible surveillance video near the nightclub on Wednesday.
> 
> According to Jackie, Ryan's bank card and driver's license were found by an ODOT crew on I-77 near the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Tuesday morning.
> 
> Family members said it's also concerning that the pills Ryan needs to take for epilepsy and mental health disorders were found in his apartment.
> 
> In addition, Jackie said Ryan's three cats were also found inside the apartment, and he would never leave them alone.
> 
> "I saw so many people online say, 'Oh, he has just gone off somewhere, or he'll show up.' It's not that. This is something that's very serious," said Ryan's Friend, Dakota Rosier.
> 
> While the family continues to post flyers around town, they're begging anyone with information to come forward.
> 
> "I can't even think anymore. I just want him to come home and be safe," Jamison said.
> 
> Ryan is white and stands 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 180 pounds. He has brown hair and eyes.
> 
> Anyone with information about Ryan's whereabouts is asked to contact the Canton Police Communication Center at 330-649-5800 or the Canton Police Detective Bureau at 330-489-3144.
