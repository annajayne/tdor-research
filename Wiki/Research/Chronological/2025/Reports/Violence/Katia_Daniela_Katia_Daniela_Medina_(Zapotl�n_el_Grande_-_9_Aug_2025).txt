> To the law enforcement authorities, to act promptly, sensitively, and respectfully, ensuring that this crime does not go unpunished; she called on the media to conduct themselves ethically, using the correct name and gender identity, avoiding revictimization and perpetuating stigma.
> 
> Finally, to society in general, so that it recognizes and respects the diversity of all people. He mentioned that the memory of Katia Daniela and her fight for trans rights compels us to redouble our efforts to build a Zapotlán el Grande free of discrimination, violence, and hate speech.
