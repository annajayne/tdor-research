> Another Transgender Person Killed in Charsadda—Justice Remains Elusive
> This is not the first such case in the district. Just last month, on February 12, another transgender person, Fazal-e-Wahid, known as Gurgura, was murdered by unidentified assailants. To date, no arrests have been made in that case either.
> 
> Charsadda witnessed yet another tragic killing of a transgender individual, this time at the hands of his own family. However, this is neither an isolated case nor the first of its kind. For years, transgender individuals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have faced relentless violence, social suppression, and murder—yet justice has remained elusive, and no concrete measures have been taken to prevent such atrocities.
> 
> The latest incident occurred in the Nasta area of Charsadda, where Ehtesham, also known as Degai, was allegedly shot dead by his father, Kausar Niaz, over a domestic dispute. According to the police, an argument erupted between the victim and his father late Saturday night. Shortly after, Kausar Niaz called his brother, Ashfaq, and confessed over the phone that he had killed his son.
> 
> Residents revealed that Degai had been forcibly married three months ago, but he refused to abandon his transgender identity. The forced marriage led to increasing domestic conflicts, and eventually, Degai divorced his spouse. This decision was reportedly unacceptable to the father, who ultimately took his son's life.
> 
> While the police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code, the suspect remains at large. Investigating officer Naushad Khan admitted that no formal inquiry had begun, citing the ongoing mourning at the victim's home. However, the lack of immediate action raises concerns about the authorities' seriousness in handling such cases, as hours have passed without evidence collection or concrete efforts to apprehend the suspect.

> This is not the first such case in Charsadda. Just last month, on February 12, another transgender person, Fazal-e-Wahid, known as Gurgura, was murdered by unidentified assailants. To date, no arrests have been made in that case either. Statistics paint a grim picture—over the past nine years, at least 147 transgender individuals have been killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, yet not a single case has seen justice delivered.
> 
> Farzana Riaz, president of the TransAction Alliance, a transgender rights organization, condemned the police's inaction and impunity for the perpetrators. "Every time a transgender person is murdered, we hear the same hollow promises, the same meaningless investigations, and then silence. Are we just numbers? Will the government and law enforcement continue to be mere spectators? It is time to end this double standard of justice. Without arrests and strict punishments, these atrocities will never stop."
> 
> Farzana further stressed that transgender individuals deserve the same basic human rights as everyone else. "If this negligence continues, we will continue to witness another Degai, another Gurgura, and we will be left with nothing but condemnation."
> 
> Despite repeated calls for action, the cycle of violence against the transgender community remains unchecked, with perpetrators walking free and authorities failing to provide the justice they deserve.
