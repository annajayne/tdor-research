> Influencer Girlalala, born Maurice Jaden Harrison, has tragically passed away at just 21 years old. Following her death, her boyfriend, Shanoyd Whyte, was arrested in Florida, according to inmate records shared on the Broward County Mugshot Facebook page. While much of the industry has remained silent in the wake of her passing, rapper Jatavia Johnson, known as JT, has spoken out against those mocking her death. JT not only condemned the behaviour but also donated over $13,000 to her GoFundMe campaign, urging fans to contribute and honour her memory.

> Girlalala tragically died at the age of 21 after being fatally shot in her apartment in Florida. Her boyfriend, Shanoyd Whyte, was arrested in connection with her death and faces charges of premeditated first-degree murder with a firearm. Reports suggest that the shooting followed a domestic dispute, with previous social media posts indicating a history of tension in their relationship. The news of her passing has shocked her fans and the online community, prompting an outpouring of grief and support, including a GoFundMe campaign that has raised over $19,000 to assist with funeral expenses and honour her memory.
> 
> Taking to her Instagram shortly after news of Girlalala’s death went viral, JT shared a heartfelt post, writing, "Rest in peace, beautiful Girlalala! We love you, and Heaven will never be boring now that you’re there. Your boldness, energy, humour, and beauty will be missed! You never missed a chance to show me love, and for that, I’m forever grateful. I’m so sorry this happened to you. We have to stop thinking things are funny just because of the way the story is told. If you see content about domestic violence, don’t laugh—especially because it involves a Black trans woman. We have a way of laughing through our pain because we’ve been conditioned to be treated as a joke." She also urged fans to donate to her GoFundMe, writing, "if you can donate $5.00, donate," followed by the hashtag #protecttranswomen."
