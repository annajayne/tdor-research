shot


> According to a trans feminist org in Urugay, a 29 yo trans woman, Johanna, was murdered at her home in Bella Italia, Montevideo the 28th July around 23h. She was first reported as a man.


> A man was sentenced this Friday for the murder of a 29-year-old trans woman, shot in the head at her home in the Bella Italia neighborhood. The incident occurred on calles Copérnico and Carlomagno.
> 
> According to police information on the case, several criminals entered the nine-square-meter precarious home and opened fire on the people who were there at the time.
> 
> There were two people in the house: a 29-year-old trans woman with five prior criminal records for theft, fraud, and receiving stolen goods, and a 33-year-old man. The woman died at the scene after being shot in the head, while the man was wounded and ran from the house.
> 
> The police and prosecutors' hypothesis is that the attack was directed at the man and that the trans woman was a collateral victim. In this case, Homicide Unit investigators conducted several raids in the Bella Italia area and arrested the perpetrator.
> 
> Following the court hearing, the man was sentenced to seven years in prison for the homicide. The investigation into the case continues, as the police believe there may be more people involved in the crime.




> From the Human Rights Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic, we express our profound sorrow and outrage at the murder of a trans person on July 29th. A crime that has plunged the entire society into mourning and challenges us to redouble our commitment to human rights, equality, and dignity.
>
> We reaffirm the value of the right to life. Today, as so often, communication fails once again, denying and rendering invisible a person's gender identity, even after death.
> 
> From this office, we advocate for respect for the life and identity of every person. Proper naming is not a symbolic act; it's an act of justice, memory, and dignity.
> 
> Denying identities is another form of violence. It makes people invisible, it perpetuates hatred and exclusion that all too often result in murder, and it violates human rights.
