> January 24, 2025. On January 23, 2025, in the municipality of Hispania, in the Vereda La Seca, Carolina, a trans woman from the municipality of Jericó, was found dead. She had lived in Andes for several years and worked as a coffee picker. According to preliminary information from the Judicial Investigation Section (SIJIN), the scene of the events was subject to a technical inspection and collection of evidence to help clarify the case. The body was found with her hands and feet tied, and showed signs of having been murdered with the use of a firearm.
> 
> This crime has raised concerns in the community and in human rights organizations, which have reiterated the need to implement more effective measures to guarantee the safety of the LGBTIQ+ population. This brings the total number of murders of LGBTIQ+ people in Antioquia to six, which is worrying due to the onslaught of violence and the lack of specific actions. It is clear that there is an urgent need to strengthen public policies to combat prejudice-based violence and ensure justice for the victims.
> 
> On the other hand, the Human Rights Observatory of Caribe Affirmativo recorded, from January 1 to 24, 11 violent deaths, of which 10 correspond to homicides and/or femicides. It is important to clarify that, if the events recorded on December 31, 2024 are added, 13 murders have been recorded to date.
> 
> We urge the Attorney General's Office to investigate these cases by applying Directive 007, which establishes specific guidelines for addressing crimes motivated by the victims' sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression. It is crucial that all indications of prejudice that may have influenced these murders are considered. The rigorous application of this directive is not only a legal commitment, but also an essential step to guarantee the respect and dignity of LGBTIQ+ people, as well as to strengthen the trust of this population in State institutions.
> 
> Carolina's case highlights the vulnerable situation faced by LGBTIQ+ people in rural areas of the country, where discrimination and lack of access to protection mechanisms increase the risks. Various social organizations have requested that this homicide be investigated with a differential approach and that those responsible be brought to justice.
> 
> We urgently call on local, departmental and national authorities to join forces to prevent violence and guarantee effective protection for this population group. We stand in solidarity with family and friends, hoping for justice in this case.
