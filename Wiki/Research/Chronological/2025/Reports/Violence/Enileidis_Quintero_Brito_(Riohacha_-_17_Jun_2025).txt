> A woman identified as Enileidis Quintero Brito, a member of the LGBTI community, was shot to death in the 10th district, at the intersection of 44th Street and 12A Avenue in the 31 de Octubre neighborhood of Riohacha, La Guajira.
> 
> According to the National Police report, the attack was carried out by two individuals on a motorcycle. They arrived at the scene and, without saying a word, opened fire repeatedly on Enileidis Quintero Brito, who was shot several times and died at the scene.
> 
> After the attack, the alleged hitmen fled to an unknown location, while local residents immediately notified authorities. Minutes later, National Police units and agents from the Technical Investigation Unit (CTI) of the Attorney General's Office arrived at the scene, cordoned off the crime scene, and proceeded to conduct a technical inspection of the body. The body was then transferred to the Forensic Medicine morgue for the necessary procedures.
> 
> So far, it has not been clearly determined whether this was a crime of intolerance or a settling of scores. However, authorities indicated that the corresponding investigative work has already begun to establish the motive for the homicide and find the perpetrators and masterminds. "We are collecting witness statements, reviewing security cameras in the area, and analyzing possible prior threats against the victim. We are not ruling out any hypothesis," said a spokesperson for the National Police in La Guajira.
> 
> Various LGBTI groups and human rights organizations in the department have expressed their concern about the incident and called for the case not to go unpunished. They also demanded that a differential approach be taken into account in handling the crime, as this represents a new case of violence against trans people in Colombia.


> The hitman attack was recorded on security cameras.
> A new bloodbath occurred in the city of Riohacha (La Guajira), where a trans woman was killed while sharing a public establishment with friends in the district's Commune 10.
> 
> The victim was identified as 38-year-old Emileidis López Bolívar, who apparently belonged to the LGBTI community . She was left lying on the floor of the establishment called "Los recuerdos de ella" (Her Memories) after being shot five times in the head and chest.
> 
> A police source learned that the gunmen arrived on a black and red motorcycle, and the passenger got off the vehicle, approached the victim, and fired shots. The incident generated fear among those present who were sharing the scene.
> 
> Guajira Police authorities arrived at the crime scene and cordoned off the area, while units from the Attorney General's Office's CTI (Inspection and Investigation Unit) conducted a technical inspection of the body. Additionally, evidence and testimony were collected to try to clarify the events.
> 
> The latest bloodshed has sparked outrage among residents and members of the LGBTI community in the capital of La Guajira, who are demanding justice and guarantees for their safety . Those close to Enileidis claim she was a very loving and beloved woman, and they demand justice to clarify her cruel murder and capture those responsible.
> 
> Meanwhile , the police source revealed that the woman was allegedly involved in drug dealing in that large area of Riohacha; however, they will verify whether her murder is related to her actions.
> 
> Authorities immediately activated a "Plan Paddado" (Lockdown Plan) , taking into account that the perpetrators were recorded on security cameras, with the goal of capturing the criminals.
