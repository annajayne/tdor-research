> Transsexual is murdered by her boyfriend and brother-in-law after inviting them to eat pizza
> The incident took place in Minas Gerais. According to the victim's work friends, the nursing technician said that if she disappeared, it would be her boyfriend's fault.
> 
> Nursing technician Pâmela Nunes Valadares, 28, invited her own killers to eat pizza on the night she was killed in Frutal, in the Triângulo Mineiro region.
> 
> The victim's boyfriend and brother-in-law, who are suspected of the crime, told the Civil Police that they were drinking together when the victim tried to slap his brother-in-law. He didn't like it and demanded that Pâmela apologize.
> 
> "The victim slapped her brother-in-law a second time, who said that he wanted to kill her. He waited for the pizza to be delivered and demanded again that she apologize. When she refused, he went after her, punched her and started to strangle her," said Civil Police Chief Fabrício Altemar.
> 
> After seeing his girlfriend being hung by her brother, Pamela's boyfriend said he helped him and they ended up killing her. After dumping the body in the countryside, the suspects returned to the victim's house and even the pizza.
> 
> Born in Tocantins, Pâmela was a trans woman and worked in two hospitals in Frutal, one of which was part of the public network.
> 
> After the gathering that culminated in the murder of the nursing technician, the suspects threw the woman's body into a pit in the rural area of the city.
> 
> "When Pamela's brother-in-law saw that she wasn't going to apologize, he started to attack her with punches. He said in his testimony that one of the blows broke one of the victim's teeth. We will wait for the results of the forensic examination to see if this really happened. Pamela then went after him and that's when he threw her against a pillar and started to strangle her," said the police officer.
> 
> Then, Pamela's brother-in-law and boyfriend took a rope and hung her to death.
> 
> The victim's body was placed by the criminals in a wheelbarrow, taken to a farm where Pâmela's boyfriend had lived and thrown into a pit.
> 
> "They wrapped the body in a blanket and used the same rope they had used to hang her to tie her arms and legs. After getting rid of the body, the two men went back to Pamela's house and even pizza while they thought about what to do. Their plan was to escape and they were even going to furnish their new house with the victim's furniture."
> 
> According to the PM, a team was called to check the victim's house after she did not show up for work at the hospital. Pâmela's friends had reportedly sent messages to the victim, who responded but refused to send audio messages when requested.
> 
> The friends even told the officers that the victim said that if she disappeared, it would be her boyfriend's fault. She also reported being the victim of aggression committed by her partner.
