strangled


> A transgender woman was found dead in her home in the town of Mariano Acosta , in Merlo, and the Justice ordered the arrest of her partner after learning the results of the autopsy, which determined that the cause of death was strangulation .
> 
> The incident became known when the couple's neighbors called 911 regarding the absence of Leyla Alejandra Parra , 49. Upon receiving the notification, police responded to the home located at 4200 calle Arrecifes and confirmed her death. This led to the opening of an investigation into the cause of death.
> 
> Prosecutors Marina Rueda and Leandro Vaccaro, in charge of the 11th UFI of the MorÃ³n Judicial Department , went to the scene to supervise the initial investigation. Since there was no medical expert at the scene who could evaluate the body, they arranged for the body to be taken to the morgue for an autopsy to determine the cause of death.
> 
> An examination of the victim's body revealed a fracture of the hyoid bone, located in the anterior region of the neck, a common injury in cases of strangulation. Furthermore, forensic investigators determined that death occurred between 24 and 48 hours before the discovery. According to information published by the Primerplanoonline website , the results indicated that the compression exerted on Parra's neck caused mechanical asphyxiation and pulmonary edema.
> 
> Regarding the relationship between the victim and the suspect, sources involved in the case indicated that they had been together for approximately eight months and that there were sporadic arguments . They also noted excessive alcohol consumption by both parties . However, the records show no prior reports of violence or restraining orders.
> 
> After the forensic diagnosis was confirmed, several people close to Parra sought out his partner to confront him. The man, identified as JCC , 47, showed up at the police station claiming to fear retaliation for the lynching attempts, but was ultimately arrested.
> 
> The prosecutor ordered his arrest, and he was taken into police custody. The man remains in the 6th precinct, awaiting the preliminary hearing scheduled for Wednesday, while the case progresses. The charge against him is the murder of a transgender woman, within the context of domestic violence.
> 
> The case remains in the preliminary investigation stage and remains under investigation by the prosecutor's office. The investigation, led by the 11th Criminal Investigation Unit (UFI) seeks to determine whether there were contextual factors related to gender-based violence and the exact dynamics that led to the victim's death.
