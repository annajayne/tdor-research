> On February 26 2025 at a party, a married couple killed a trans woman known as Arina "Nefs" "Demchuk". She apparently was a sex worker and friend of the couple. It happened in Murino, near St. Petersburg. Some articles seem to corroborate these photos are from Arina :

> The murder details are gruesome and media articles really dissected the victim's life online while misgendering and deadnaming her. Since one of the murderers is a trans woman too, articles pilled on the case with little respect and weaponized queer communities in Russia.

> A trans person, along with her cis partner, murdered and dismembered another trans person (formerly, their friend) in Russia, Spb. Local news outlets call all three, including the victim, basically subhuman and seemingly are more interested in prosecuting the murderers for being a part of lgbtq.

> Two suspects in the murder of a man in St. Petersburg have been detained in Karelia. They brutally dealt with their acquaintance, dismembering his body, after which they put the parts in suitcases and dumped them on the banks of the Neva. During interrogation, it turned out that the victim and one of the suspects were transgender*, who had changed their gender to female. Vechernyaya Moskva reported on the details of the confusing murder, as well as the identities of the victim and the criminals.
> 
> Two suitcases, one black and one pink, were found on March 1 near Slavyanskaya Street, building 3. They were noticed by a "walrus" - a local resident who was swimming nearby in the Neva. The man was alarmed by a sharp, unpleasant smell coming from the suitcases. When he opened them, he found fragments of the body of the murdered man . Immediately after this, the man called the police. A criminal investigation was launched into the discovery of the body.
> 
> As it turned out later, the murder was committed on February 26 in a rented apartment on Aviatorov Baltiki Street in the city of Murino in the Leningrad Region. The video from the surveillance cameras shows the married couple rolling two suitcases on wheels out of the entrance.
> 
> The arrest of the suspects was reported on March 3. They turned out to be a married couple , Lolita and Daniil Kuznetsov. They were caught in Petrozavodsk and taken to St. Petersburg for questioning. There, investigators found out that the couple had killed their acquaintance and, in order to hide the traces of the crime, dismembered his body, put the remains in suitcases and left them by the Neva.
> 
> During the interrogation of the detainees, it turned out that Lolita was a man. Until 2023, the transgender* was called Arkady, and later he decided to change his gender to female. It is noteworthy that the body parts of the murdered man also belonged to a transgender* man named Vyacheslav.
> 
> — It was also established that the body, whose remains were found in the suitcase, belonged to a man. He was wearing thong underwear, — a source told RIA Novosti .
> 
> The murder occurred due to a conflict based on jealousy. Vyacheslav allegedly attacked Lolita with a knife, after which her husband grabbed him and beat him to death. The victim's girlfriend, with whom he was talking at the time of the conflict, noted in a conversation with " 78.ru " that the man had harassed Vyacheslav.
> 
> The couple lived in the same apartment for several days with the corpse of their friend. After the couple got rid of it, they fled to Karelia, where law enforcement officers found them.

> What is known about the suspects
> 27-year-old Daniil Kuznetsov from Moscow was involved in sports and talked about healthy eating on his social networks. His wife is from Segezha (Karelia). Before her gender reassignment*, her name was Arkady Stepin, after several operations she took a new name - Lolita.
> 
> Lolita called herself a "sorceress" on social media and went to trash shows where she doused other participants with slop and paint. According to Lolita herself, she was also in a psychiatric hospital, where she was sent from the police department after a rowdy incident.

The deceased positioned himself as a girl and took the pseudonym Arina Nefs. His profile is posted on several sites with explicit offers, as well as on porn sites.
> 
> The guy also considered himself a member of the "emo" movement. Even before his transformation* into a girl, he had a characteristic fringe and piercings on his face.
> 
> This is not the first high-profile case involving bodies found in St. Petersburg. Last year, a woman's dismembered body was found in a car , in a plastic barrel of acid. According to law enforcement, the man killed his common-law wife, cut up her body and placed the remains in the barrel. The suspect's ex-wife recorded his confession on audio and contacted the police.
> 
> Earlier in St. Petersburg, 20-year-old blogger Alexander Sinko confessed to the murder of 53-year-old Vitaly Ioffe. Sinko, who was involved in the LGBT* movement, claimed that the victim tried to rape him. After the murder, the blogger contacted his Telegram subscribers, where he described the incident in detail and shared photos of the murdered man. In search of help, he also discussed the possibility of fleeing the country.
