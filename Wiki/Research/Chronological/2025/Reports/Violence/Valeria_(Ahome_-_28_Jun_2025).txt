murdered


> Sinaloa.- LGBTIQA+ organizations and human rights activists issued a statement demanding that the murder of La Vale, a trans woman found dead on June 28 in Ahome, be investigated as a hate crime based on gender identity.
> 
> Vale had been reported missing since June 15 and was found dead days later, on a plot of land in the Ejido 5 de Mayo, in the aforementioned municipality.
> 
> According to the National Observatory of Hate Crimes against LGBT+ People, this is the 25th hate crime recorded in Sinaloa since 2013.
> 
> Tiago Ventura, president of the Sinaloa Inclusive civil association, stated that La Vale's murder was not a crime of passion or a coincidence, but rather a hate-filled transfeminicidal crime. He therefore called on authorities to act with diligence, a gender perspective, and a differentiated approach.
> 
> "They should investigate, punish, and not re-victimize. Impunity cannot continue to be the norm," the statement stated.
> 
> In a joint statement signed by Erika Acosta, an LGBTIQA+ activist from Ahome, and Tiago Ventura, they condemned La Vale's murder and urged the State Attorney General's Office to investigate the incident as a hate crime based on gender identity, following protocols for action with a perspective on sexual diversity and human rights.
> 
> At the same time, they demanded that the media stop violating the memory and identity of trans people, as they have found that various media outlets have reported on the case using language that denies or erases their gender identity.
> 
> Finally, they demanded that the Sinaloa government implement urgent actions, with resources and political will, to prevent and eradicate violence against LGBTIQA+ populations, particularly trans women.
> 
> “We stand in solidarity with her family, her friends, and all the trans women who today feel fear, anger, and exhaustion. Vale had a name, a story, and dreams. She was murdered for who she was. This is called transphobia, and we cannot allow it to continue to be normalized,” they stated.
