> "It's like, it's really like it got the whole family in like an uproar. It's like one of those things like you don't know what to feel. You wanna be angry, you wanna be sad, you wanna cry, you wanna scream,” Broom's aunt Patricia Bender explained.
> 
> Even after the arrest of the person police believe is responsible, there are still a lot of questions going through Bender's mind.

> 
> "That brought some peace, but that don't take away the pain,” Bender said. “You just wanna know why, like why did you do that? Why do you feel like she deserved for that to happen, you know, and then that way and that magnitude."
> 
> Bender says her niece loved making people laugh, was full of energy and confidence and loved Nicki Minaj.
> 
> 
> "Funny, smart like one of those people that can walk into the darkest room and find some light in it," Bender said.
> 
> She's hoping people see Broom in that bright light instead of focusing on what she did for work.
> 
> "You can't judge a person by their actions or something that they do,” Bender said.
> 
> 
> Southfield police say they haven't ruled out the possibility that Broom was targeted. The suspect made 33 calls to sex workers, including Black transgender women like Broom.
> 
> "I believe that now that this has happened, he wants to try to distance himself from that reality, but no he knew. I believe it was possibly maybe even a motive for the robbery as well because when he was interviewed, turns out he didn't have any money, so how was he going to pay for services if you will, but he was carrying a gun," Southfield Police Chief Elvin Barren said.
> 
> 
> But the evil that happened and investigation into it won't stop them from celebrating who she was.
> 
> "She shine a light that's gonna shine forever and ever and ever and ever," Bender said.
> 
> The family says they're grateful for the outpouring of support in Michigan. There will be a balloon release in Cleveland, where Broom is from, at Woodhill Park Friday.





> The Michigan LGBTQ+ community is grieving the loss of Tahiry Broom, a 29-year-old transgender woman from Cleveland who was fatally shot in Southfield on Feb. 9. Robert Ridges III, 28, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with her death.
> 
> “We unfortunately, as a community, just closed the chapter in receiving justice for another trans woman of color, Ashia Davis, and now, less than 90 days later we are hoping to get justice for Tahiry Broom,” Julisa Abad, victim advocate and Director of Outreach at Fair Michigan, told Pride Source. “The violence that my community faces goes to show that this is an epidemic that is not ending anytime soon.”
> 
> Prosecutors allege that Ridges met Broom near the Riverstone Apartments complex before the shooting occurred following an altercation. According to multiple reports, Broom was found dead, facedown in the snow outside the apartment complex on the morning of Feb. 9.
> 
> Ridges was arrested at the MGM Grand Casino in Detroit hours later. He faces multiple charges, including second-degree murder, carrying a concealed weapon and felony firearm possession. Ridges' bond was denied and his next court appointment is Feb. 26.
> 
> Southfield Police are considering hate crime charges, according to Fox 2 Detroit.
> 
> Southfield Police Chief Elvin Barren told the outlet that he had spoken to Broom's mother. "She shared with me how much she meant to her, how she was a very intelligent person," Barren said. "She mentioned that it was a joy. Certainly, a joy to her life."
> 
> In a statement, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald emphasized the fundamental right to safety for all individuals. “Every person is entitled to live without fear of violence. Tahiry Broom had family and friends who loved her. She did not deserve to die and her killer will be brought to justice,” McDonald said. (Editor's Note: Pride Source has chosen not to link to the Oakland County webpage as the news release about this incident includes the legal name given to the victim at birth. A county representative explained that Broom's birth name had been shared widely in other media and that it was not their intention to deadname her.)

> Advocate Jeynce Poindexter said there's danger in the growing negative rhetoric regarding the trans community:
> 
> "What continues to happen is by the trans community being labeled as the other and constantly ostracized, it allows for victimization to creep in at every angle ... harassment, discrimination, violence, the threat of, or essentially in this case, murder. Hatred breeds hatred," said Poindexter.
