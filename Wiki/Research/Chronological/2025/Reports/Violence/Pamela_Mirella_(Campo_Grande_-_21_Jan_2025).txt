> Iraides Rosa Ferreira traveled 833 kilometers from Trindade (GO) to Campo Grande for a far from easy farewell. Her daughter was cruelly murdered. Pamela Myrela, 31, a transgender woman, had 90% of her body set on fire in the early hours of Sunday (19), when she was at home in Vila Carvalho. The crime was motivated by a disagreement in a nightclub in the capital with two other trans women, who were arrested.
> 
> Iraides arrived this morning (21) in Campo Grande and, unfortunately, to take care of the funeral arrangements. She spoke emotionally when remembering her daughter, who had lived in Campo Grande for about 10 years. "A cheerful, happy and affectionate person. There was no bad time for her. She really enjoyed living here."
> 
> Pamela was the oldest daughter. "She was my companion, she called me every day to see how I was doing and she called her younger sister too. Every year-end she would come and see me, it was sacred," says Iraides. "She spent the end of the year with us, she came here on Wednesday and this happened to her on Sunday. We had parties, got the family together and she was there with us like every year," recalls her mother.
> 
> Iraides says he does not know the motive for the crime and demands justice. "The person who did this has to pay." Unable to cover the funeral costs, especially the R$12,000 transfer of the body to Goiás, the family has started a fundraising campaign. Funds can be transferred using the Pix key: 62 992586602.
> 
> Pamela's boyfriend, Renan Castilho, also spoke to the press while awaiting the proceedings at the police station. He believes that Pamela had disagreements with the two other trans people suspected of committing the crime and is demanding justice. "They destroyed us, our family, we had been together for 8 years. She was a super good person, a companion, a fighter. She fought and had a bright future ahead of her," he said.

> The representative of ATTMS (Association of Transvestites and Transsexuals of Mato Grosso do Sul) also supports Pamela's family. "The association's position is the same as that of the entire society, we cannot agree with this barbarity, we will demand it like anyone else as a family and help in any way we can because we seek justice," she concluded.
> 
> Understand - The crime happened after a disagreement at a nightclub on Saturday night (18). Two other transsexuals, known as Baby and Yara, went to Pamela Myrela's house and threw a Molotov cocktail at the victim, in the early hours of Sunday (19). Then, they set it on fire.
> 
> The bedroom of the property was hit, but a neighbor managed to control the flames and remove the victim from the house. Still conscious, waiting for help, Pamela told the police about the disagreement at the nightclub. She also revealed that Baby and Yara had a pimp, who owned a boarding house, and that she had ordered the crime. Pamela also reported that she had had a previous disagreement with the pimp.
> 
> Baby and Yara were located and arrested at the boarding house in the Amambaí neighborhood. The owner of the boarding house was interviewed by the police and confirmed that she had a disagreement with Pamela about six years ago, but denied any involvement in the crime. The woman said that Baby and Yara arrived at the boarding house and said that they had set Pamela on fire.
> 
> Help  - Pamela was rescued with 90% of her body burned and taken to Santa Casa de Campo Grande in a very serious condition. She did not resist and her death was confirmed by the medical team at 5:37 am this Tuesday (21).




> Justice upholds arrest of duo for killing Pâmela burned with gasoline in Campo Grande
> Pâmela Myrela had 90% of her body burned after her house was set on fire over the weekend and died this Tuesday (21)
> Livia Bezerra –Published on 01/21/2025 – 13:06
> 
> The court upheld the arrest of the two transvestites, aged 22 and 35, accused of the death of Pâmela Myrela, aged 31, this Tuesday (21). The crime took place in the early hours of Sunday (19) when the victim had 90% of her body burned after having her house set on fire with gasoline in Vila Carvalho, in Campo Grande.
> 

> Pâmela was hospitalized at Santa Casa in a very serious condition until the early hours of Tuesday (21). She had 2nd and 3rd degree burns all over her back, face, neck and limbs, but did not survive her injuries and died.
> 
> The two accused were arrested in flagrante delicto in the early hours of Monday (20) by the Civil Police. On the morning of Tuesday (21), they went through a custody hearing, where the judge, Eucelia Moreira Cassal, decided on preventive detention. 
> 
> Regarding the 22-year-old woman – also involved in the death of truck driver Jeferson Pontes Barbosa, 13 days ago in a motel in Vila Taveirópolis – the judge considered the concrete gravity of the crime committed through cruel means, collaborating in the fire at Pamela's house.
> 
> Personality
> Furthermore, according to the judge, the transvestite has the personality to commit a violent crime. “Despite her first offense, I note that the prisoner has the personality to commit a violent crime, as well as due to the lack of proof of lawful work and fixed residence, I understand that it is not advisable to grant provisional liberty, nor is it advisable to grant more lenient precautionary measures,” decreed Judge Eucelia Moreira.
> 
> At the custody hearing of the other accused, the judge highlighted that she collaborated to create the fire in the property where Pâmela was that Sunday morning (29). “Which demonstrates a personality inclined towards the practice of violent crimes and, although she has no criminal record, is sufficient for her segregation”. 
> 
> Therefore, the judge ordered the preventive arrest of both and they were sent to prison.
> 
> “No mother wants this,” says Iraides about her daughter's death
> Alongside friends and her son-in-law, Pâmela Myrela's mother, quite shaken, said that she had been with her daughter four days before the incident. The crime took place during Trans Visibility Month.
> 
> Iraides Rosa Ferreira explained that Pâmela is from Trindade, in Goiás, and came to Mato Grosso do Sul ten years ago for work. “She really liked Campo Grande,” she said. The family is raising funds to have her buried in Goiás.
> 
> She explained that her daughter was a happy and very affectionate person. As the whole family lives in Goiás, Pâmela, who is the oldest of the siblings, in addition to calling her mother every day, went to her hometown every year.
> 
> She had even gone there at the end of the year and returned to Campo Grande last Wednesday (15), four days before the crime. “She left on Wednesday and this tragedy happened on Sunday,” lamented the mother.
> 
> The mother, as soon as she found out about the case, organized to come to MS, but arrived on Tuesday (21) with the worst news, that of her daughter's death. "No mother wants this. She doesn't want her child taken away from her mother," she said.
> 
> The family wants Pâmela's wake and burial to take place in Trindade, Goiás, the city where she was born. To this end, they are asking for help to cover the cost of transporting the body and other expenses. They hope to raise around R$10,000 to help.
> 
> Help of any amount through Pix from Pâmela's mother,  Iraides Rosa Ferreira (62) 99258-6602 .
> 
> Discussion and crime
> Pâmela had been hospitalized since  Sunday (19) after her body was set on fire in Vila Carvalho , in Campo Grande. She did not resist and died in the early hours of Tuesday (21).

> The transvestite had been involved in an argument at a nightclub. She then went home, but the two perpetrators, enraged, went to a gas station, bought gasoline and headed to the victim's house.
> 
> There they called the victim, who, upon leaving the gate, had his body hit by fuel. Then, the perpetrators set the victim on fire.
> 
> The victim's friend, aged 26, gave a statement at the police station, where she reported that  the two went to a nightclub on Saturday night (18) with three other friends . Around 3 am, two transvestites arrived at the location, altered and apparently under the influence of drugs or alcohol. According to the friend, the pair were looking for trouble at the location.
> 
> Victim was in shock and had a burned body
> Still in her statement, the victim's friend said that after changing clothes, she returned to her property, at which point she came across the transvestite standing at the door in shock and with her entire body burned. 
> 
> The woman told police that the victim asked her to help her dog, who was under the bed. So, she entered the house, saw the property burned and managed to help the animal, according to the testimony. 
> 
> However, as the friend was leaving the house with the dog in her arms, she saw the two suspects returning to the scene and screaming. The victim then asked her friend to run away. She then let go of the dog and ran home, where she grabbed a knife and returned to the victim's home a few minutes later. 
> 
> Suspects fled
> However, when the friend arrived at the transvestite's property, the friend stated that the pair had already disappeared from the place. Then, the victim allegedly said to her friend: “Look what she sent to me, look what her girls did, look how I looked, friend”, according to the police report. 
> 
> Soon, the friend noticed that the transvestite's body was covered in smoke and burned, but she did not say she was in pain, she was just asking for her pet dog to be saved. Before help arrived, the victim had even asked to smoke a cigarette. 
> 
> Then, a SAMU (Mobile Emergency Care Service) team arrived and provided first aid, but the victim fainted due to the burns. The team took her to Santa Casa, with more than 90% of her body burned, where she was intubated in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) in a very serious condition. 
> 
> According to the police report, the victim's respiratory system was severely affected by the fire.
>

> 
> The couple were sleeping when they were arrested 
> Heard at the police station, one of the investigators who was on duty in the early hours of Monday (20) said that a team went to the address of the transvestites suspected of committing the crime. 
> 
> Upon arriving at the scene, the team called out to the residents and a woman greeted them – initially identified as the alleged mastermind behind the crime by the victim. The woman then pointed out where the pair were sleeping in the property. The police woke them up and took them to the police station. There, they made an arrest.
> 
> Alleged mastermind denies involvement in the crime
> The alleged mastermind was heard as a witness. She told the police that she owns a boarding house in the Amambaí neighborhood, where one of the suspects has lived for six months. The other transvestite, aged 22, has lived in the property for about two weeks.
> 
> At the police station, she claimed that around 9 am on Sunday (19) the couple arrived at the boarding house in an altered state and appearing to be under the influence of drugs. At the time, the couple said they had fought at the nightclub and set the transvestite on fire. Soon, the owner of the boarding house allegedly said: “nice, huh, now the police are coming and arresting you”, according to the police report.
> 
> Later, during the early hours of the morning, the Civil Police arrived at the property looking for the three women. The owner soon said that she had heard about the victim's health condition. She also stated that another transvestite had called her and told her that someone else had said that she was the mastermind behind the crime.
> 
> However, the woman denied any involvement in the attempted murder, claiming that she did not leave the house or speak to the pair.
> 
> The woman also said that about six years ago there was a disagreement between her and another transvestite, and the victim got involved in the fight. At the time, a police report was filed. Afterwards, she claims that she no longer had contact with the victim and the situation was resolved.
> 
> Finally, the woman reported that the transvestites referred to her as a pimp, but claimed that she is only the owner of the boarding house.

The suspects were charged with attempted qualified homicide for a futile reason and with the use of fire.
> 
> According to police, the crime occurred after a fight at a nightclub in the Vila Carvalho neighborhood, where all of them worked as call girls.
