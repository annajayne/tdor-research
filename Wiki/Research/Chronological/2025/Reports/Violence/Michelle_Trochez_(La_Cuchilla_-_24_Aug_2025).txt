> Tegucigalpa, Honduras – The wave of violence against the LGBTIQ+ population gained momentum again this August in Honduras, with at least three murders of trans women in the northern and western parts of the country in a period of less than 15 days.
> 
> The cases include the murder of [Moisa Castillo](https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2025/08/09/moisa-reyes-castillo_san-pedro-sula-cortes-honduras_2dae426e), which occurred on August 8 in the Boquerón neighborhood of San Pedro Sula; the murder of a [trans woman] on August 13 in the Sandoval Sorto neighborhood; and the violent death of Michelle Tróchez, 24, which occurred on August 24 in the village of La Cuchilla, in the department of Santa Bárbara.
> 
> “It is quite worrying because these patterns of violence have been repeated and what we are seeing is that hate speech, even promoted by local and central governments, fuels this dangerous climate for the LGBTIQ+ community,” said Alondra Miranda , advisor and human rights promoter of the Kukulkán Association and member of the Pink Unity Collective in an interview with  Criterio.hn.
