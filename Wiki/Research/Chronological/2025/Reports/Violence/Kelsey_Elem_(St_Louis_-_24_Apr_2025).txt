> 25 year old Black trans woman fatally shot by boyfriend in St. Louis - Pittsburgh Lesbian Correspondents
> Her name was Kelsey Elem. She was 25 years old when her boyfriend killed her after an argument. They both lived in St. Louis.
> 
> St. Louis County Police reported an altercation broke out in the 5800 block of Grace Avenue between Kelsey and her partner, Martino Lewis. Reportedly, an eyewitness overheard an argument. Elem’s family said that it escalated into the man they call ‘Tino’ punching Elem so badly in the mouth that she started bleeding.
> 
> According to KSDK, documents from the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said Elem was afraid Lewis was going to get her gun and asked a witness to call police. While the witness was on the phone with 911, they heard a gunshot and saw Lewis run out of the house to drive away in Elem’s car. 
> 
> Police charged Lewis with second degree murder, armed criminal action and domestic assault.
> 
> Her family had to clean out her apartment, describing harrowing details. It seems like a terrifying violent attack.
> 
> Kelsey was born in Atlanta. Her family relocated to St. Louis where Kelsey attended East St. Louis High School, then studied at Duke University. She worked retail at Hollister and then moved into food service as a manager at McDonalds. She did some training to become a medical assistant. Her Facebook posts reiterate her work ethic – she typically had two jobs, bought her own car and set up her own apartment at age 18.
> 
> Her birthday was November 5.
> 
> Zioreyah Moton emphasized how amazing her older sister was. 
> 
> “She can light up the room,” Moton said. “She’s very playful. She’s funny. She’s outspoken. I can describe Kelsey in so many ways. She was just a light, she was my world, my best friend.” 
> 
> Family said she was an advocate for the transgender community and was a consistent friend to strangers. 
> 
> The day before her death, Kelsey posted a heart wrenching tribute to her transition.
> 
> Yall my Transition was so epic it was a surprise to me but a surprise to yall it some I always wanted to do In now I’m happy enough to embrace It took a lot for me get here in a couple years but hey I did I’m proud of my lifeee in so many ways it just shocks me wen I look back like I was tht dude now tht Girl but yea moral of story love your life 
> 
> She didn’t know that might be her last post, but it is a humbling tribute to the resiliency and self-awareness of this young woman. I’m still not sure if its a comfort that she gets to have the final say, however unintentional. It is heartbreaking that her final words came at such a young age.
> 
> She deserved to be loved by someone who would respect and value her.
> 
> Elem’s funeral service is scheduled for May 9 at Nash Funeral Home in East St. Louis. Her mother set up a GoFundMe to help with her final expenses.
> 
> Kelsey is the seventh trans person whose death has been reported in 2025. She is the sixth trans woman, the fifth Black trans woman, the sixth Black trans person, and the seventh transgender person of color on our list.
> 
> Previous reports from Missouri: 2024 Kita Bee 2023 Amber Minor 2022 Dee Dee Kandii Redd 2021 Dominique Lucious 2020 Nina Pop and Aerrion Burnett 2019 Brooklyn Lindsey. That’s at least one Black trans woman each year.
> 
> All of the people on our list for this year are BIPOC folx. Not most of them, not the majority – all of them. Six were Black and one was Latinx. That is not a minor detail.
> 
> Rest in power, Kelsey. Thank you for your final message to us, affirming how much we should embrace the trans community and support young people transitioning. The kindness and generosity of your heart will live on. You should be able to trust that the intimate people in your life will treat you with respect and dignity. I am so very sorry your life ended in violence.
> 
> May your memory be a revolution.
