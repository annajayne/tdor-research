> A trans man was murdered in Barrancabermeja
>
> January 14, 2025. On the night of January 13, violence struck LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia again. This time, Diany Ruiz, a trans man who was part of the Magdalena Diversa Foundation, was shot dead at the Ibiza commercial establishment, located in the Villarelis Tercera Escena neighborhood, commune 7, near the 07 de Abril neighborhood, in the city of Barrancabermeja . The victim was intercepted by individuals traveling on a motorcycle, who fired several shots that caused serious injuries. Despite medical efforts to save his life, Diany Ruiz was transferred to a health center, where he unfortunately died due to the severity of his injuries.
> 
> This is the sixth murder of an LGBTIQ+ person in Colombia in the first 14 days of 2025, according to the Human Rights Observatory of Caribe Afirmativo. This alarming figure reflects the deep dynamics of structural violence that affect our population and demonstrates the urgent need for effective measures to protect the lives and rights of LGBTIQ+ people throughout the country.
> 
> It is imperative that the national government, together with local authorities, implement effective policies and measures to stop this wave of violence. We reiterate the call for a real commitment to justice and respect for human rights, and we urgently call on civil society to collectively demand a country free of violence and discrimination for LGBTIQ+ people.
> 
> It is essential that a rigorous investigation be carried out with a human rights perspective, taking into account the specific risks faced by LGBTIQ+ people in their daily lives, ensuring that the motives for the crime are clarified and justice is achieved in Diany's case. 
> 
> Furthermore, it is urgent to prioritize measures that ensure protection and access to justice for victims of violence, implementing effective prevention strategies that address the particular realities and vulnerabilities of the LGBTIQ+ community, especially trans women, who are in a context of high exposure to violence and discrimination. The implementation of these measures is essential to safeguard the integrity and rights of this historically marginalized population.
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo we condemn this new act of violence and express our most sincere condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of Diany Ruiz. This murder is a painful reminder of the lack of guarantees for the life and safety of LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia.
