> 
> January 11, 2025. With deep pain and concern, we at Caribe Affirmativo denounce the murder of Natalia Santodomingo, a trans woman living in Cajicá, Cundinamarca, which occurred on January 9, 2025.
> 
> “We condemn the transfeminicide of Natalia Santodomingo, a trans woman and resident of Cajicá, which occurred on January 9 of this year. We cannot normalize that such aberrant and discriminatory acts that end the lives of diverse people occur in our municipality. We embrace her family, friends and loved ones,” stated the LGBTIQ+ Community Roundtable of Cajicá. 
> 
> We urgently call on the Attorney General's Office to investigate this crime with a gender perspective, guaranteeing the strict application of the guidelines of Directive 007, an essential instrument to clarify whether this incident was motivated by Natalia's gender identity and to ensure that there is no impunity in this case.  
> 
> In a country where trans people are disproportionately vulnerable to violence, it is essential that institutions act quickly and with commitment to prevent, punish and eradicate attacks based on transphobic prejudices. Natalia's murder not only violates her fundamental right to life, but also reaffirms the need to build a more just, inclusive and diverse-respecting society.  
> 
> We demand from the authorities:  
> 
> – Rigorous research with a human rights perspective that takes into account the specific risks faced by trans people.  
> 
> – That the necessary measures be prioritized to clarify the motives for the crime and ensure justice for Natalia.  
> 
> – That effective prevention and protection strategies be implemented for LGBTIQ+ people, especially trans women, who live in a highly vulnerable context.  
> 
> From Caribe Afirmativo we express our solidarity with Natalia's family and friends and reaffirm our commitment to accompany this process so that her murder does not go unpunished. Her memory calls us to continue working for a country where all people can live free, safe and with dignity, regardless of their gender identity.
