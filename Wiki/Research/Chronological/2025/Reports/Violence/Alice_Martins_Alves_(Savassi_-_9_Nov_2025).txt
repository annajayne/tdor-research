beaten


> A transgender woman died this Sunday morning (November 9th), 18 days after being attacked by a stranger in Savassi, South-Central Region of Belo Horizonte (MG).
> 
> In the early morning of October 23, Alice Martins Alves, 33, left a bar at the intersection of Rua Sergipe and Avenida Getúlio Vargas. After crossing the avenue, in front of another bar located at the corner of Avenida do Contorno and Avenida Getúlio Vargas, the woman began to be assaulted by a stranger, accompanied by two other men who laughed at the violent acts.
> 
> In the police report filed by the victim herself on November 5th, the aggressor was identified as a tall, white man with dark brown or black hair, wearing jeans and a black shirt. Alice reported that she did not know the aggressor, that the acts of violence were unexpected, without her being able to react or even understand the motivation, which can be classified as transphobia .
> 
> “They have to try to catch this individual; there are many cameras in Savassi. If people are willing, they can identify this person,” said Alice's father, Edson Alves Pereira, distraught. “I want this to be investigated so that no one else goes through this. It's so cowardly. The State is very negligent; we have to report that a crazy aggressor is walking around, attacking LGBT people in the streets, so that people are aware,” he added.
> 
> After being assaulted, Alice lost consciousness and only woke up while being attended to by paramedics. She was taken to the UPA Centro-Sul emergency care unit, where she received initial medical treatment.
> 
> On November 2nd, she was taken by ambulance to the Unimed Emergency Room in Contagem (MG), in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, accompanied by her father. Several injuries were found, including cuts on her nose, a deviated septum, and fractured ribs. In the police report, the assaulted woman agreed to present the medical report when requested by the investigation, which was forwarded to the Specialized Police Station for the Investigation of Crimes of Racism, Xenophobia, LGBTphobia and Related Intolerances (Decrin), of the Civil Police of Minas Gerais.
> 
> Why is May 17th the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia?
> Edson reports that, after the attack, Alice was very distressed and weak, as well as traumatized. On Saturday (November 8th), after being diagnosed with contamination of her body caused by a perforation of her intestine from one of her broken ribs, the victim underwent a cleaning procedure and surgery, but died this Sunday (November 9th).
> 
> 'Dad, look what they did to me'
> Edson recalled that his daughter sent him a photo minutes before being attacked. “When she was being treated at the emergency room, she didn't want to call me because I was having some high blood pressure tests done. She went home by Uber. When I woke up at 3 a.m., I went to her room to check on her and she had a bandage on her nose, her mouth was all bruised. She said, 'Dad, look what they did to me,'” the distraught father recounted, minutes after learning of his daughter's death.
> 
> In an interview with Estado de Minas , federal deputy Duda Salabert (PDT), an activist in the fight for LGBTQIAPN+ rights, expressed outrage at the death of yet another trans woman in a context of violence. 
> 
> “It’s devastating to lose another one of our own. There’s no justification. Brazil remains the country that kills the most transgender people because the State fails at the basics. There are no statistics on the crimes, on the investigations carried out and those that aren’t. Alice was attacked almost twenty days ago and there isn’t a single identified suspect. I always ask the same question: who benefits from this omission?” she asks.
> 
> The congresswoman said her team has already contacted Alice's family. "Violence against transgender people doesn't come from nowhere; it stems from societal inaction. As long as there isn't serious investigation, protection, and policies to combat transphobia, new crimes will continue to happen and, unfortunately, will go unpunished."
> 
> Contacted for comment, the Civil Police of Minas Gerais (PCMG) did not comment on the progress of the investigations into Alice's case because, due to the on-call system in effect on weekends and holidays, this information is not updated.
