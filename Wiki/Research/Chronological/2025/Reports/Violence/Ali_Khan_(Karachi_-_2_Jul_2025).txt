> KARACHI:
> The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) expressed concern over the killing of 21-year-old Ali Khan in Orangi Town, reportedly at the hands of his father, for the deceased's alleged association with the transgender community.
> 
> This incident, reportedly involving torture and subsequent murder, is not an isolated case but a reflection of persistent societal transphobia and the dangerous attitudes that continue to place transgender people, and those working for their rights, at risk of violence.
> 
> The SHRC, over the years, has undertaken initiatives for the protection and support of the transgender community, including protection against harassment,and the facilitation of CNICs for transgender individuals. However, despite these initiatives, members of the transgender community continue to face discrimination, systemic neglect, and threats to their safety. This is exacerbated by institutional gaps, social stigma, and the weak enforcement of existing laws, which limit the impact of efforts aimed at ensuring the dignity and safety of the transgender community.
> 
> Ali Khan's murder is a reminder that the absence of protective measures and institutional safeguards facilitate such acts of hate and violence. The SHRC reiterated its call for the enactment of a special law for the protection and welfare of transgender individuals in Sindh, as well as those associated with them.
