> 
> A 28 year old transgender Shahab alias Wafa, was shot in the head and killed on Saturday night while returning from a performance program in the Badraga area of Dargai, (Hari Chand), District Malakand. Wafa was from Taro Jaba, District Mardan.
> 
> On the night of May 24, while returning from a wedding event, where Wafa had given a dance performance, a man named Shaukat intercepted her as she exited the gate of the venue. Shaukat, armed with a Kalashnikov, was with an unidentified accomplice. At first the attempted to abduct her, but when she tried to speed away in her vehicle, the assailants opened indiscriminate fire, fatally wounding her. Wafa was shot in the head and died on the spot, while her ‘driver’, Naveed Ahmed sustained serious injuries from the gunfire – later after talking to the police from the hospital, Naveed became the complainant of an FIR.
> 
> The First Information Report (FIR) for Wafa’s murder case was registered the next day, on May 25 at the Bacha Khan Shaheed Koper Police Station under Sections 427 (mischief causing damage), 302 (murder), 324 (attempted murder), and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
> 
> The FIR specifies how Wafa and several other transgender individuals, who had attended the wedding ceremony were stopped by two men on a motorcycle as they left the venue. When they sped away to avoid the confrontation, the two assailants—one identified as Shaukat and the other still unknown—opened fire with a Kalashnikov. Wafa, who was seated in the front seat, was shot in the head and died on the spot. Naveed who was driving sustained serious injuries due to the gunfire.
> 
> The incident has caused panic and fear among the transgender community. The police say that after registering the case proceedings have begun against the suspect Shaukat, and the unidentified assailant.
> 
> According to the FIR, Shaukat, had previously been in a relationship with Wafa. However, the relationship ended abruptly, which angered Shaukat, ultimately leading him to commit the act out of revenge.
> 
> Case Investigation Officer (IO) Qayyum, told Voicepk they were probing the incident.
> 
> “No arrests have been made as yet, but we are actively investigating the case,” he said. “The perpetrators were not present inside the wedding function. They were standing outside the venue gate.”
> 
> He added that he had already spoken to Naveed, who had sustained multiple gunshot injuries and was recovering. “He is out of danger and will record his statement once fully recovered,” Qayyum said.
> 
> Station In-charge Noor Zameen Shah also spoke to Voicepk, revealing further details: “The deceased and the accused Shaukat had been in a relationship for two years. After it ended, Wafa entered a new relationship with Naveed. Shaukat was unhappy with this, which is believed to be the motive behind the murder.”
> 
> Shah added, “The wedding took place in Shaukat’s own village. When he learned that Wafa was attending, he carried out the attack.”
> 
> He also confirmed that Shaukat has no prior criminal record and works in the vegetable market. “He used to visit Wafa often,” Shah said. He concluded by noting that the local community is deeply frightened by the incident. “We are trying to gather information and locate Shaukat. We hope to apprehend him soon.”
> 
> In response to the incident, the representative of the transgender community from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Farzana Riaz expressed deep sorrow.
> 
> “It is extremely tragic that another member of the transgender community has been gunned down. This violence continues unabated—sometimes we are extorted, and other times we are shot.”
> 
> Wafa’s brutal murder is yet another tragic reminder of the growing insecurity faced by transgender individuals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Despite repeated pleas for protection, the community continues to suffer unchecked violence, with little to no accountability. As activists call for swift justice and systemic reform, the silence and inaction from the authorities only reinforce the perception that the lives of transgender persons remain dangerously undervalued in Pakistan.
