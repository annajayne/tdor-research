> Ecuadorian authorities are investigating the death of 24-year-old Lorena Irisbell Salazar Luisa, who died in the community of Salinas, Santa Elena province. The young woman, known as Iris, was studying law at the Santa Elena Peninsula State University (UPSE) and was recognized for her social commitment.
> 
> Lorena Irisbell was in her fifth semester of college. She was actively involved in social causes and initiatives supporting the LGBTI community. Her colleagues and friends remember her as a dedicated, caring person with a strong commitment to justice. Her goal was to become a lawyer to support those most in need.
> 
> On the night of the incident, Iris was walking through the Brisas del Mar neighborhood when she was intercepted by an individual. According to police reports, she tried to take cover by banging on the door of a nearby house, but received no response. Shortly after, the assailant shot her, leaving her dead on the street.
> 
> Friends, acquaintances, and members of the public expressed their sadness and demanded clarification of the events. Iris was also a sports enthusiast and used to run along the beach every morning. Neighbors in the area where the incident occurred commented that they always saw her active and smiling.



> Asociación Silueta X, a member of the Federación Ecuatoriana de Organizaciones LGBTI+ y de la Plataforma Nacional Trans “CoaliTrans”, together with olectivo Chicas Trans Ruta Spondylus de Santa Elena, denounce with deep indignation and pain the brutal murder of a trans woman, whom we will refer to by the pseudonym Lorena (Runa Sipiy coding SX-SAL-25062101), to protect her identity and dignity, according to the protocols of the Runa Sipiy Observatory.
> 
> On Wednesday, [May] 21, 2025, in the afternoon, in the Brisas del Mar neighborhood, Salinas canton, Santa Elena province, a violent act of assassination claimed the life of Lorena, a young fifth-semester law student at the Santa Elena Peninsula State University (UPSE). According to information provided by the Chicas Trans Ruta Spondylus Collective, the echoes of several gunshots alerted neighbors, who observed a motorcycle speeding away. Minutes later, Lorena was found dead near the entrance of a home, the victim of a firearm attack.
> 
> Preliminary information indicates that, following a chase, the National Police arrested a suspected perpetrator, identified as Damián M., near the canton cemetery. Lorena's body was taken to the Santa Elena amphitheater for the corresponding procedures. The UPSE university community expressed its solidarity in a statement, mourning the emotional loss and extending condolences to her loved ones.
> 
> The Runa Sipiy Report by the Silueta X Association, which records transfemicides, LGBTI+ murders, unexplained violent deaths or suspected criminal deaths, records this case as a new event that mourns our community in 2025. This crime adds to the alarming figures of violence against trans populations in Ecuador, where 73.3% of the murders of LGBTI+ people in 2024 corresponded to trans women, according to the annual report presented in February 2025.
> 
> We urgently call on the Attorney General's Office, the Police Commander, and the Ombudsman to conduct a thorough, swift, and transparent investigation that will identify and punish those responsible for this atrocious act.
> 
> We demand safety guarantees for trans people and their families, as well as the implementation of an early warning system to prevent violence against our community, as we have repeatedly requested.
> 
> The Silueta X Association, the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI+ Organizations, and CoaliTrans strongly reject this new transfemicide and reiterate their commitment to the fight for justice, equity, and the protection of the human rights of LGBTI+ people.
> 
> NOTE: To request information on this case, a formal letter with a signature of responsibility addressed to info@siluetax.org with a copy to fedelgbt@gmail.com is required . Additional information 0982001871 & 0981339708.
