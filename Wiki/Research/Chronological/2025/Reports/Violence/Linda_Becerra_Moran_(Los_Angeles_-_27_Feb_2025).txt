>
> A trans woman was shot by police at a Pacoima motel last month after she called 911 for help, then approached officers with a knife, according to video footage released Sunday by the Los Angeles Police Department.
> 
> Linda Becerra Moran, 30, died Feb. 27 after weeks on life support, leaving her friends and community advocates shaken.
> 
> Becerra Moran had told an emergency operator she was being kidnapped in the 10000 block of San Fernando Road on the morning of Feb. 7.
> 
> Footage of the encounter showed officers speaking in Spanish with a distraught Becerra Moran in the moments leading up to the shooting, keeping their guns drawn as she paced inside a motel room and they stood in the doorway. They opened fire after she moved slowly toward them, the video showed.
> 
> Becerra Moran had reported being held against her will in the motel room as a possible victim of sex trafficking, said Soma Snakeoil, executive director of the Sidewalk Project, a Skid Row nonprofit.
> 
> Becerra Moran was hospitalized in grave condition after the shooting, Snakeoil said, and the decision to end life support was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital where she was being treated after attempts to reach family members in her native Ecuador were unsuccessful. The L.A. County Medical Examiner's Office said information about the case remained limited because "legal next of kin have not been notified." The LAPD did not acknowledge the death for more than a week.
> 
> Becerra Moran left behind almost no online presence, and mystery surrounds how she ended up at the San Fernando Valley motel where police shot her.
> 
> “This has such chilling connotations for survivors in L.A. — if they’re afraid to call 911, if they’re afraid that police are going to shoot them when they call 911,” said Snakeoil.
> 
> The LAPD identified the officer responsible for the shooting as Jacob Sanchez, a four-year department veteran currently assigned to Foothill Division.
> 
> Authorities have so far released few additional details about the deadly encounter, including whether they detained Becerra Moran's alleged captor when they arrived.
> 
> In her conversation with a 911 dispatcher, a distraught-sounding Becerra Moran is heard saying that a man in a different room was holding her against her will, and bringing other men into the room.
> 
> "I swear to you, I have no reason to lie to you. Lord Jesus Christ," she is heard sobbing in the phone.
> 
> "Are they forcing you to do this?" the dispatcher asks.
> 
> "Yes," Becerra Moran responds.
> 
> A dispatcher then put out an alert to Foothill police units about a possible kidnapping and a person who posed a "danger to herself," police said.
> 
> The video released by police shows a group of officers entering the room and asking Becerra Moran to sit on the bed as she shows them a wound she has on the back of the head from getting hit "many times" with a bottle.
> 
> Later, the officer who was examining her head for injuries suggests to his colleagues that the officers should place her on a mental health "hold."
> 
> When a supervisor arrives, she becomes upset and demands that they stay away from her, sobbing and yelling at the officers to leave.
> 
> "No, if you guys were offering to help, I don't want your help," she yells at them. "What's she saying?" the supervisor asks. She then begins pushing a mini-fridge in their direction, before grabbing a knife and holding it to her neck, prompting officers to draw their weapons.
> 
> When she moved in their direction, Sanchez opened fire, and she fell onto the bed.
> 
> As with all LAPD shootings, the incident will also be reviewed by the Police Commission, its inspector general and the district attorney’s office.
> 
> Snakeoil, whose organization offers services for unhoused people, said she first encountered Becerra Moran at MacArthur Park in late 2023, when police were warning about a serial killer who appeared to be targeting homeless people.
> 
> At the time, Becerra Moran was "fleeing from sexual violence," Snakeoil said, and the organization worked to get her temporarily housed in local motels. But she never stayed in one place for too long, drifting between Westlake and Hollywood.
> 
> Across Los Angeles County, Snakeoil said, shelter beds for female survivors of human trafficking are scarce, especially for those who are trans or who struggle with mental health.
> 
> Kim Soriano, a researcher with the Sidewalk Project, remembers Becerra Moran for her independent-mindedness.
> 
> "She was just determined to survive. She was very resilient; like she knew what she wanted and she knew what she liked and what made her comfortable," Soriano said, who would run into her while researching her dissertation on police treatment of trans and queer people at MacArthur Park.
> 
> A devout Catholic, Becerra Moran owned a five-pound statuette of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which took up most of the space in the battered suitcase that she lugged around.
> 
> "She told me that she carried it all around with her and it offered her protection," said Soriano. Once, she recalled, Becerra Moran saying of the statuette: "Be careful with her, because she's come a long way with me."
> 
> Over the months, the two of them bonded, Soriano said, talking often about Becerra Moran navigating life as a trans woman of color who supported herself as a sex worker while living on the streets. For her, threats were everywhere. Gangs. Drugs. Police.
> 
> Soriano said Becerra Moran was among the park regulars who expressed a grudging acceptance of law enforcement. Like the others, she'd gotten swept up by the seemingly endless cleanups targeting drug use and theft in the area — tents were dismantled, belongings seized and people forced to leave. And yet she ultimately felt police were there for protection, Soriano said.
> 
> "She called them when she needed help because she was being held hostage and trafficked and they met her with even more violence," Soriano said. "Maybe she did believe that they would be some type of lifeline for her."
> 
> Becerra Moran had been awarded a housing voucher, but "no one had placed her anywhere" given the city's shortage of short-term shelter and housing options, Soriano said. Eventually, with Soriano's help, she secured a bed at an area shelter.
> 
> She didn't stay long. She was frustrated over having some of her possessions thrown away by shelter staff, shortly after moving in, Soriano said. She also recalled Becerra Moran feeling unsafe after being placed in a dorm-style room with three other occupants.
> 
> When Becerra Moran ended up back on the streets and lost her phone, Soriano fell out of touch.
> 
> Soriano said she continued doing her outreach at MacArthur Park, hoping to run into Becerra Moran again. She never did.
> 
> Leigh LaChapelle, an associate director at the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, said Becerra Moran's case was a reminder of why police are not the answer to helping trafficking survivors. In recent years, law enforcement authorities have announced stepped-up crackdowns to curb the business along well-known "tracks."
> 
> “They see them through the lens of criminality rather than vulnerability and treat them as people who need support,” said LaChapelle. "I'm so worried about this getting written off as a mistake or as a sort of exception."
> 
> Snakeoil, of the Sidewalk Project, said that she visited Becerra Moran several times in the hospital, offering up words of encouragement from her bedside — praying that Becerra Moran could hear them from under a tangle of tubes keeping her alive. During the visits, the room remained under guard by two LAPD officers, Snakeoil said.
> 
> At some point, she noticed that Becerra Moran's cherished Virgin of Guadalupe figure was nowhere to be found. A Sidewalk Project worker rushed off to buy a replacement, which Snakeoil placed beside the hospital bed. It remained there as Snakeoil said their goodbyes.
> 
> “We’re angry," Snakeoil said. "This is a vulnerable woman and a survivor of violence."




> The Los Angeles Police Department released video footage of the fatal shooting of a trans sex worker last month at a Pacoima motel.
> 
> The footage was released on Mar. 9 which shows LAPD officers responding to a 911 call where the caller indicated they were a victim of a kidnapping.
> 
> Officers were called to a Pacoima hotel in the 10000 block of San Fernando Road on the morning of Feb. 7.
> 
> The video shows the officers arriving and standing in the doorway of the motel room while the victim is holding a knife and not following commands to put the weapon down.
> 
> The video doesn’t appear to show anyone else in the room.
> 
> The video shows the victim, identified as Linda Becerra Moran, 30, began to approach the officers with knife in hand, an officer-involved shooting occurred.
> 
> Becerra Moran had reported being held against her will in the motel room as a possible victim of sex trafficking, said Soma Snakeoil, executive director of the Sidewalk Project, a Skid Row nonprofit.
> 
> Moran was rushed to a local hospital where she was placed on life support. Due to her being an Ecudorean native, the hospital made the decision to remove her from life support.
> 
> The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office has not officially identified her as they are still seeking to contact Moran’s next of kin.
> 
> It is unknown whether LAPD has either identified or arrested her alleged kidnapper(s).




> Linda Moran Killed in Pacoima Police Shooting
> Linda Moran (Full Name: Linda Becerra Moran) Died In Los Angeles Police Department Shooting After Reporting Being Kidnapped
> 
> PACOIMA, LOS ANGELES (March 9, 2025) – A transgender woman and possible victim of sex trafficking identified as Linda Moran has tragically died in a Pacoima LAPD shooting at a motel.
> 
> Los Angeles County officials are saying that the incident began on February 7. Linda Moran told emergency operators that she had been kidnapped along the 1000 block of San Fernando Road. 
> 
> Los Angeles Police Department officials arrived at the scene and began conversing with the victim in Spanish. Officers had their guns drawn and inexplicably shot her as she was slowly approaching them.
> 
> Paramedics were called to the scene in order to help the victim. She was transported to the hospital with critical injuries.
> 
> Sadly, Linda Moran died on February 27 after spending several weeks on life support. The incident has left her friends and advocates in Los Angeles County deeply concerned and angered.
> 
> The LAPD officer involved in the shooting was described as a four-year department veteran. A full investigation into the Pacoima LAPD shooting remains ongoing.
> 
> Liability for Los Angeles County Police Shootings
> Law enforcement officials in Los Angeles have a long and sordid history of engaging in excessive force against people. In 2023, Los Angeles Police Department officials shot and killed a double amputee in a wheelchair in Huntington Park. A Los Angeles Sheriff’s Deputy has also pled guilty to violently attacking a transgender man after he allegedly flipped him off. Police departments should take a number of actions in order to help prevent misconduct involving their officers.
> 
> Police departments should establish and enforce clear use of force guidelines that involve de-escalation techniques and crisis intervention.
> Police departments should train officers to handle situations where a person may be in the midst of a mental health crisis.
> Police departments should be transparent and require that all of their officers wear body cameras during encounters.
> Police departments should require that their officers undergo psychological screenings to ensure that they are fit to serve.
> 
> Police departments have a legal obligation to use the least amount of force necessary for any given encounter. According to 42 U.S. Code § 1983, every person who, under the color of law, deprives someone of their rights afforded under the Constitution shall be liable to the injured party in an action at law. When officers fail to properly assess a situation and use unnecessary force that results in a fatality, they could be found liable for violating the Fourth Amendment rights of the person who was killed. A municipal entity could also be held liable for the death of a suspect if it was due to training failures or a pattern of misconduct. 
> 
> Consider, for example, Monell v. Department of Social Services (1978). The Supreme Court held that local government agencies can be sued for violations that were a result of their own policies and customs. A police agency may have failed to train their officers on de-escalation techniques. It is also possible that a police department harbored a culture of misconduct by failing to discipline previous excessive force incidents. It is important that evidence is properly preserved after any fatal police shooting.
> 
> Body camera footage from all officers involved should be sought.
> Medical records related to the shooting should be preserved.
> The phone call to 911 that prompted the encounter should be scrutinized.
> A thorough investigation by an outside agency should be conducted.
> 
> Police shootings are often highly preventable. They tend to involve situations where officers fail to properly assess what’s going on. It is also common for officers to fail to properly de-escalate encounters before they take a violent turn. Sadly, though, the Los Angeles Police Department has proved time and time again that they will do everything in their power to deny responsibility if they shoot and kill an innocent person. This is why it is so important that any police shooting involving the LAPD is thoroughly investigated by an experienced civil rights attorney.
>
