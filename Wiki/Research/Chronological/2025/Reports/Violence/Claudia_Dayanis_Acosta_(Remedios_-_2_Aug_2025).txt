Remedios
Villa Clara
Cuba
stabbed



> Young Cuban transgender Alvaro Acosta popularly known as Claudia Acosta was assaulted in Remedios Villa Clara by a criminal identified as Yendri. The events happening at dawn yesterday in a palate when without reason the aggressor brutally punished her. The police haven't arrested the man who is free walking around like nothing and everyone claims that it is because he is a police informant and works for them. Justice for Claudia!!!   
  


> Violence in Cuba continues to rise: Transgender woman stabbed to death in Remedios, Villa Clara
> October 8, 2025
> 
> Violence has rocked the island once again. In Remedios, Villa Clara, a double murder has left its mark on the community in just a few months.
> 
> Last July, young trans woman Claudia Dayanis Acosta was stabbed inside a bar by a man identified as Yendis Hernández . Now, Yendis himself—who has also been identified as Yendis Germán—has been killed with fourteen stab wounds on the outskirts of town, in an apparent act of revenge carried out by Yuristani Carvajal, according to multiple citizen reports. Yuristani, according to several sources who spoke to Niover Licea, is barely 16 or 17 years old.
> 
> Claudia's case had a profound impact on Remedios. Much loved by her neighbors and acquaintances, she was brutally attacked by Yendris, who, according to journalist Niover Licea, had committed a similar act in the past. We don't know why, despite such a history, Yendris was free on the streets now in October.
> 
> Messages circulated on social media not only highlighting the brutality of the attack, but also the threats the young woman received from her attacker: "If she reported him, he would kill her." After the incident, Claudia became a symbol of the lack of protection for trans people in Cuba, exposed to violence that rarely finds a swift and effective institutional response.
> 
> However, now, in the early hours of Monday morning, the story took a bloody turn, and the stabber became the victim. The attacker himself was found dead, with fourteen stab wounds that reflect a pattern of cruelty similar to the one he had used against Claudia.
> 
> Yuristani Carvajal 's name appears in multiple publications as the perpetrator, although there has yet to be official confirmation from the authorities. The community interprets the outcome as a settling of scores, an act of revenge that highlights the lack of justice and the erosion of trust in institutions, according to Niover Licea himself.
>  
> The climate of violence didn't stop there. At the same time, in Candelaria, Artemisa, an elderly man who worked as a custodian at an elementary school was murdered. According to initial reports, the attackers didn't steal anything, raising suspicions of a gratuitous crime or a burglary with other motives. His death has sparked outrage: a retired man returning to work to support his family was killed while on duty.
> 
> Two incidents in just a few days—Yendris killed and Artemisa's custodian dead—reinforce the perception that violence has become normalized in Cuba, but unfortunately, there are more than two.
> 
> Independent observatories had already warned that 2025 would close with a high number of femicides and hate crimes, but what these stories reveal is something else: the fractured social fabric, the absence of prevention mechanisms, and the feeling that justice is being administered into one's own hands.
> 
> The echo on social media mixes anger, resignation, and calls for a firm hand. But beyond the clamor for exemplary punishments, the central message is that Claudia's stabbing, and the death of Yendris, along with that of the guard in Artemisa, are symptoms of the same evil: a country where violence is growing faster than the state's response.
