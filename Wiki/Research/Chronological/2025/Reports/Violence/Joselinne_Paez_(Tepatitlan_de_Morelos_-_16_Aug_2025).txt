> Tuesday, August 19, 2025 · 8:45 AM
> 
> GUADALAJARA Jal., (apro) LGBT+ groups such as Colectiva Disidente LGBTepa + and Unión Diversa de Jalisco spoke out strongly following the death of Joselinne Páez, a trans woman who was the victim of a brutal beating in Tepatitlán, Morelos. Páez, who was beaten on August 10 and taken to a hospital in Zapopan, succumbed to her injuries on August 16. 
> 
> According to the police report, Páez was found on August 10 on calle 16 de Septiembre, behind Cerrito de La Cruz in Tepatitlán de Morelos, “with injuries apparently caused by blows to various parts of her body.” 
> 
> Justice is being demanded for the murder of trans activist Katia Daniela Medina in Jalisco.
> Her murder follows the recent homicide of Katia Daniela Medina Rafael in Zapotlán el Grande, bringing the number of trans women murdered in Jalisco in August to two. 
> 
> Fascinación Jiménez, a representative of the Diverse Union of Jalisco, also demanded that hate speech be penalized at the federal and state levels. 
> 
> “Today we are sharing the unfortunate news of the transfemicide of Joselinne Páez in Tepatitlán, Morelos. This comes one week after the murder of Katia in the municipality of Zapotlán el Grande, also in Jalisco. We at Unión Diversa de Jalisco believe that these are not isolated cases.  
> 
> This is the consequence of hate speech and the wave of hate speech that has emerged worldwide from anti-rights groups in the United Kingdom, the United States, Argentina, and even Mexico. These speeches, like those of Lili Tellez and Eduardo Berastegui, translate into violence. From here, what we are demanding is that the investigation be conducted with a gender and sexual diversity perspective, that prosecutors' offices be trained in this same regard, and that they use the federal protocols that already exist," Fascinación noted. 
> 
> In the statement, the Diverse Union of Jalisco and the Guadalajara Pride March demanded that priority be given to the initiative presented by Citizen Movement (MC) representative Monserrat Pérez in the state Congress to classify transfemicide and hate crimes. 
> 
> “We insist that the initiative presented by Representative Monserrat Pérez last week be a priority for the Jalisco State Congress. We also urge the federal government, the president, and all levels of government to legislate and prohibit hate speech, which causes so much harm to society. And we would like to highlight that in Jalisco, we have had two transfemicides so far this year. Jalisco is among the 10 states with the highest rates of violence against people of color. We remind citizens that the average life expectancy of a trans woman is 35 years and that efforts must be redoubled to eradicate this violence,” the LGBT activist noted. 
> 
> In addition to seeking justice in the case, Unión Diversa de Jalisco also called for a ban on hate speech, events, and conferences that promote misogyny, ultraconservatism, and violence against LGBT+ communities. They are warning about a similar event, planned for 2026 in several Mexican cities, called "Fearless: Restore your Courage." 
> 
> For its part, the LGBTepa+ Dissident Collective also joined the demands, urging the Jalisco State Attorney General's Office to investigate Joselinne's case with due perspective and to guarantee the safety of sexual dissidents in Tepatitlán de Morelos. 
> 
> The LGBTepa+ Dissident Collective stated that Joselinne Páez was a beautiful transgender woman from Tepatitlán de Morelos, Jalisco, who was brutally beaten just a few days ago. The injuries resulting from the attack landed her in critical care, and despite receiving medical attention, "her life was violently and unjustly taken." 
> 
> The Collective stated that what happened to Joselinne is a transfemicide that adds to an alarming wave of violence against trans women and the diverse population in Mexico. "The data shows that these are not isolated incidents, but rather a human rights crisis marked by hatred, discrimination, and a lack of justice, because in the vast majority of cases, the crimes remain unpunished." 
> 
> The civil association asks the Tepatitlán city council to make the city safe for sexual dissidents. "We want to live a life free of violence, without fear that our identity will become a death sentence." 
> 
> Friends and activists remember Joselinne as a cheerful and charismatic person, while the LGBT+ community mourns the loss and demands concrete actions to prevent future acts of violence. 
> 
> “As a community, we demand concrete security actions and effective public policies that protect our lives: clear protocols, mandatory training for security forces and prosecutors' offices with a gender and diversity focus, prevention of hate speech, criminalization of transfemicide, real support for families and communities, and coordination mechanisms between authorities and LGBTTTIQ+ groups. Joselinne's memory calls us to continue organizing. May her name be a seed of justice, dignity, and a full life for all. RIP Joselinne,” was the message posted by her friend Astrid Denisse González.




> Colectivas y activistas exigen justicia por transfeminicidio de Joselinne Páez
> Guadalajara. The Guadalajara Pride March and the Diverse Union Association of Jalisco demanded justice for Joselinne Páez, who was murdered in Tepatitlán, in the Altos region of Jalisco. This case was classified as transfemicide. This brings the number of murders of LGBTI+ people recorded in Mexico so far this year to 22, and "represents a national emergency." 
> 
> Two such homicides have occurred in Jalisco, the other of Katia Daniela Medina Rafael, director of the Zapotlán Trans Collective and a human rights activist, in the first week of August. Both transgender women died from the beatings they sustained.
> 
> The organizations urged Jalisco's municipalities to strengthen efforts to ensure an environment free of violence and discrimination for trans women. 
> 
> They affirmed that the initiative presented by Representative Monserrat Pérez is a legislative priority and demanded federal and state criminalization of hate speech based on gender identity, sexual orientation, gender expression, race, and ethnicity, among others. 
> 
> In a joint statement, the collectives stated that transfemicides are not isolated cases and that hate speech has consequences. They urged zero tolerance for transphobic and transhating speech, also calling on the Mexican presidency to halt such statements.
> 
> The organizations identified an event scheduled for 2026 in several cities, including Puebla, Mexico City, Querétaro, and Guadalajara, that "contains content that is anti-LGBT+," featuring Eduardo Verastegui, among others, and insisted that authorities put an end to such expressions.
