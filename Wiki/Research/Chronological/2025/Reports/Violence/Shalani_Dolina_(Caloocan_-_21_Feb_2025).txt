dismembered


The dismembered body of Shalani Dolina was found in Caloocan, Metro Manilla (Philippines) on 21 Feb 2025.

She was 37.




> Last February 21, Shalani Dolina, a 37-year-old transgender woman, was found dead in a house in Brgy. Bagong Silang, Caloocan City.
> 
> Dolina was reported missing for three days before her body was found. Police investigators found her severed leg in an ice cooler, and the rest of her body wrapped in a mattress.
> 
> I a statement condemning the killing, LGBTQIA organization Bahaghari stated that “the brutal and senseless killing of a trans woman… is a horrific act of violence that underscores the dangers that LGBTQ+ individuals continue to face.”
> 
> Bahaghari, therefore, called for the Caloocan authorities to conduct an investigation on the brutal killing of Dolina.
> 
> “No individual should ever face horrendous acts of discrimination and even death because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, yet incidents like this still happen,” Bahaghari stated. “This unnecessary loss of life serves as a painful reminder of the desperate need for protective and inclusive legislation such as the Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) Equality Bill in order to promote the safety of LGBTQ+ individuals.”
> 
> Bahaghari similarly urged Caloocan City Mayor Along Malapitan to enact an Anti-Discrimination Ordinance in the city to curb future incidents of discrimination and gender-based violence.


> Bahaghari UP Tacloban expresses its deepest outrage and condemnation over the brutal  murder of Shalani Dolina, a 37-year-old trans woman, whose lifeless body was discovered on February 21 in Brgy. Bagong Silang, Caloocan City. The details emerging from the police investigation are inhumane and deeply disturbing, with reports indicating her severed leg was found heartlessly stored in an ice cooler, while her body was wrapped in a mattress. This gruesome act is not merely a crime; it is a blatant act of violence fueled by hate, prejudice, and a deep-seated disrespect for human life, specifically targeting a member of our vulnerable LGBTQIA+ community.
>
> This heinous crime against Shalani Dolina is an indictment of the systemic discrimination and prevalent dangers faced by the members of LGBTQIA+ community in the country. This tragedy exposes the urgent need of promoting awareness, understanding, and respect for the rights and identities of LGBTQIA+ community. Violence, harassment, and discrimination remain constant threats to the LGBTQIA+ community simply because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression. Standing against such brutality, we remain in steadfast solidarity with Shalani’s family, friends, and loved ones as they mourn this loss. 
>
> We call for an urgent, thorough, and transparent investigation into Shalani’s murder. The perpetrators of this heinous crime must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law. We urge authorities to consider the classification of this crime as a hate crime and to prosecute it accordingly, reinforcing the message that violence against LGBTQIA+ individuals has no place in our society. 
>
> The state and the system have repeatedly failed to serve justice for the LGBTQIA+ community, leaving victims of harassment, discrimination, and murder without justice. Time and time again, our existence is denied, our rights ignored—and the long-stalled SOGIESC Equality Bill in Congress is a proof of this neglect the refusal to pass this bill reflects a deep disregard for the safety and dignity of the LGBTQIA+ community. But for as long as we exist, we will continue to resist these injustices.
>
> Bahaghari UP Tacloban remains steadfast in its commitment to advocating for the rights and safety of the LGBTQIA+ community. Shalani’s death should never have happened. It is a painful reflection of the violence and injustice that persist in our society. This is why we remain relentless in our fight for a just, equitable, and inclusive society—one where no one’s life is endangered simply for being who they are.



> The brutal and senseless killing of trans woman, Shalani (37), in Brgy. 176, Bagong Silang, Caloocan is a horrific act of violence that underscores the dangers that LGBTQ+ individuals continue to face. No individual should ever face horrendous acts of discrimination and even death because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, yet incidents like still happen. 
> 
> This unnecessary loss of life serves as a painful reminder of the desperate need for protective and inclusive legislation such as the SOGIE Equality Bill in order to promote the safety of LGBTQ+ individuals. We strongly condemn this heinous crime and demand that justice be promptly served for the victim and their loved ones. 
> 
> We call on the North Caloocan Police to take continuous action to find and apprehend the perpetrator and ensure that they are held fully accountable for their actions. We also call on the Caloocan City Mayor, Along Malapitan, to enact a Anti-Discrimination Ordinance in the city of Caloocan to curb future incidents of discrimination in the city. Furthermore, we reiterate the need for a national anti-discrimination policy. We urge Pres. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to make the SOGIE Equality Bill a priority! Pass the SOGIE Equality Bill now! Stop trans killings!

> Early this year, two transgender women have also fallen victim to violence: Ren Tampus, a 35-year-old beauty salon owner, who was gunned down in January in General Santos; and Shalani, who was found dead and dismembered in February in Caloocan City.
> 
> These killings, marked by cruelty and impunity, reflect a disturbing pattern of transfemicide—the gender-based killing of transgender women—driven by misogyny, transphobia, and the systemic belief that their lives are disposable. It is imperative that our society name this violence for what it is.
> 
> On its part, the Commission has endorsed these cases to the respective CHR Regional Offices for investigation. As the country’s Gender Ombud, we remain relentless in our call to advocate for policies and laws which protect the rights of the LGBTQIA community.
