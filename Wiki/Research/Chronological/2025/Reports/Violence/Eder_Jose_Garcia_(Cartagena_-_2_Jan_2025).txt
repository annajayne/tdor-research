> The death of Eder José García Hurtado is confusing. There are more questions than answers about what happened to him in an apartment in the Las Gaviotas neighborhood. The only thing confirmed so far is that the man was killed with a sharp weapon.
> 
> The Metropolitan Police of Cartagena issued a statement and announced that at 10 am on Thursday, January 2, the lifeless and decomposed body of this 50-year-old man was found. According to the institution's report, García Hurtado had a stab wound; However, it did not provide details of how the attack occurred.
> 
> The investigation of the crime is being carried out by the Technical Investigation Corps (CTI) of the Attorney General's Office, which was responsible for carrying out the technical inspection of the body that was then taken to the morgue of Legal Medicine in Cartagena.

> Who killed Eder José? Why and when? These are just some of the questions that remain about this mysterious crime. The neighborhood is shocked and moved, saying they do not know the motives or the date on which it was committed. Given the state of decomposition of the body, they assume that the victim was attacked days before.
> 
> El Universal learned that García Hurtado lived in Las Gaviotas, but frequented the Pie del Cerro neighborhood for his work related to tourism in Cartagena. There are several hypotheses on social media about how his crime was committed, but none of these versions have been confirmed or denied by the Police.
