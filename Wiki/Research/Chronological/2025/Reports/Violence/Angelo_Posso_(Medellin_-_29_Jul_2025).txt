> 
> A new murder of an LGBTI person has been reported in Medellín. Authorities found the body of Ángelo Posso, 43, inside his home in the Llanaditas neighborhood, showing signs of violence. Broken glass was also found inside the house.
> 
> The crime occurred on the morning of Tuesday, July 29, in the Villa Hermosa district. The Aburrá Valley Police reported that neighbors called the emergency line because they saw blood coming from the house.
> 
> Posso was found by authorities with wounds on various parts of his body, including his arms and legs, as well as lacerations on his hands that indicated he had struggled with the attacker.
> 
> "Based on information from a human source, we know that Ángelo Posso had problems with neighbors in the area, and that they sometimes became aggressive," said General William Castaño, commander of the Metropolitan Police of the Aburrá Valley, regarding the initial investigation.
> 
> Harley Córdoba, director of Human Rights for the LGBTI Social Alliance of Antioquia, stated something contrary. He told Semana: "We know he lived alone, had a good relationship with his neighbors, and led a very quiet life."
> 
> For its part, the organization Caribe Afirmativo emphasized that "Ángelo Posso was a trans man, and his gender identity must be recognized, made visible, and respected. His murder not only brings grief to those who shared his life, but also represents a new warning against the systematic violence that trans people face in Colombia."
> 
> In addition, the organization highlighted that 51 LGBTI people have been murdered this year, three of whom were trans men. They also called on regional authorities. "We urge the Mayor's Office of Medellín to urgently strengthen protection and prevention channels for the at-risk community, guaranteeing comprehensive actions that respond to the context of structural violence they face."
