Bolívar

tortured and murdered



> The murder of Débora, known as "La Pajarita," has reignited concerns about extreme violence against transgender women in Ecuador. After disappearing in Los Ríos province, her body was found in Bolívar province with preliminary signs of torture.
> 
> Débora, known online as “La Pajarita,” was found dead on November 9th on the Echandía–Caluma road in Bolívar province. Her disappearance had been reported the day before by activist groups in Los Ríos. The case, being investigated as a possible transfemicide, once again highlights the extreme violence faced by trans women in the country.
> 
> The information was confirmed by Diane Rodríguez, a member of the Silueta X organization. She has accompanied Débora since 2021, when the young woman suffered an attack in her hometown of Ventanas.
> 
> Case chronology
> In the early hours of November 8, trans collectives in the Los Ríos region alerted Silueta X about Débora's disappearance. From that moment, the Runa Sipiy Observatory—which records acts of violence against LGBTIQ+ people—activated a follow-up on the case.
> 
> Less than 24 hours later, the young woman's body was found in Bolívar, far from her hometown. According to Rodríguez, preliminary data gathered by local organizations indicates that the victim was tortured before being murdered. However, the official autopsy report has not yet been released.
> 
> Violence on the rise
> The Silueta X Association has recorded 18 murders of LGBTIQ+ people so far this year. Of these, 12 were trans women, according to the annual Runa Sipiy report.
> 
> Rodríguez explains that many attacks occur within a context of widespread insecurity. People with low economic exposure can be mistakenly perceived as having resources. In Débora's case, her activity on TikTok—where she shared humorous content and glimpses into her daily life—may have been interpreted that way by criminal groups, although the organization rules out the possibility that she had a high income.
> 
> “These cases are not related to organized crime on the part of the victims,” Rodríguez states. “They also affect shopkeepers and low-income individuals, who become targets of extortion and kidnapping.”
> 
> Concern over the lack of research
> Silueta X questions the lack of visible progress from the Prosecutor's Office regarding crimes against LGBTIQ+ people. According to Rodríguez, there is no public clarity about the status of the cases.
> 
> “We don’t know how many cases are under preliminary investigation, how many have been sentenced, or how many have been archived. This information should be public,” he says.
> 
> The organization insists that cases like Débora's should be treated as femicides, taking into account the victims' gender identity. This is despite the fact that transfemicide is not specifically defined in the Comprehensive Organic Criminal Code.
> 
> Call to the authorities
> Silueta X and the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI Organizations demand that hate crimes receive priority attention. They also call on the Prosecutor's Office to implement clear follow-up mechanisms for murders and disappearances.
> 
> For these organizations, an effective institutional response is key to curbing impunity and preventing cases like Débora's from happening again.
> 
> “We hope the situation will change,” Rodríguez adds. She points out that all the documentation they maintain regarding acts of violence is public and available to the authorities.





> #ATENCIÓN | The lifeless body of Deborah, known as 'La Pajarita' —a trans woman— was found on the Echeandía-Caluma road, Bolívar province.
> 
> The Silueta X Association regrets and condemns the incident and demands that the Public Prosecutor's Office conduct a thorough investigation.
