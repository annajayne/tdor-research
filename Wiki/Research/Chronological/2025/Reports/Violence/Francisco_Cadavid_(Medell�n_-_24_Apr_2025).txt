> Jacques León, a renowned leader of the LGBTQ+ community, expressed his deep concern about the escalating violence against this segment of the population in the Aburrá Valley.  “What's happening to this segment of the population is, without a doubt, hatred and  simple gender-based persecution ,” León stated, recalling recent cases like that of Sara Millerey, which occurred less than a week ago.

LGBTQ+ groups have indicated that, with this death, Francisco becomes the 31st victim of homophobic violence in the country so far this year, and the 15th in the department of Antioquia, figures that reflect a worrying trend.
