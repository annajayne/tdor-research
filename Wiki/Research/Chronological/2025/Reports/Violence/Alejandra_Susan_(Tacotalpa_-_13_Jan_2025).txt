The early morning of January 13 marked the beginning of a new year with a tragedy that has shaken Tabasco and Mexico: the murder of Khloe Susan , a transgender woman of just 20 years old, which occurred in her home in Tacotalpa. This crime, which the authorities are still investigating, has raised alarms about the systematic violence faced by the trans community in the country.  

According to initial reports, Khloe was attacked with a knife by a man who walked her home after finishing her work shift. The attacker fled the scene and remains at large. Her murder adds to a violent day in Tabasco, marked by other bloody events such as attacks on police cars and the discovery of dismembered bodies.
