> DETROIT (WWJ) -- The murder of 25-year-old Karmin Wells has left heartbreak, and questions in the City of Detroit. Crime Stoppers of Michigan is calling on the community to help find the person who took her life.
> 
> Wells, a transgender woman, was found fatally shot in her home near 7 Mile Rd. and Hayes on Detroit's east side on May 24.
> 
> Detroit Police, who suspect the slaying was a set-up, said Wells arranged to meet a man for a date at her house in the 15400 block of Troester St., at around 11 a.m.
> 
> Police said the suspect stayed just about ten minutes before shooting Wells, stealing her phone, and running from the scene.
> 
> Wells' aunt, Markeitha Bibb, was among loved ones who spoke at a news conference on Wednesday, pleading for tips in the case.
> 
> "I just want everyone to know that Karmin meant everything to us, to our family, the LGBT community family, and she didn't deserve this," Bibb said. "Whoever did this, quit running, quit hiding."
> 
> Also at the news conference was Wells' mother, Monica Hudson, who addressed her child's killer directly, saying: "I hope you rot in hell for what you've done."
> 
> There is a cash reward of up to $2,500 for the tip that leads to an arrest in this case.
> 
> Anyone who saw anything suspicious that day, or who knows someone who did is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-SPEAK-UP (800-773-2587).
> 
> As always, those who call the tip line will stay 100% anonymous, and will not be required to give your name, speak to police or to testify in court. The public can also submit anonymous tips online at this link.
> 
> Rewards are paid upon an arrest in a case. They do not wait for a conviction.
