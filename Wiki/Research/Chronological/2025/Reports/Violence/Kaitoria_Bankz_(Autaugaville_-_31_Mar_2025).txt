> 
> Rest in power, Kaitoria. Your work in your community saved lives and inspired so many others. Your pride in your name change and new ID is infectious joy that every trans person should be able to access if they choose. You deserved – we deserved – many more years of you sharing your lived experiences to list us all up. I am sorry we did not create a world secure enough to keep you safe. Your name will never be forgotten.

> May your memory be a revolution.
