> The lifeless body of Kendra Cabeza , a trans woman and member of the ksatransec organization , was found in a public street with signs of torture, after having been reported missing on September 22, 2025. Her death has shocked human rights organizations and activists working with the trans and LGBTIQ+ population in the country.
> 
> According to accounts, Kendra Cabeza had gone out to talk to a man before her disappearance. With no news, her colleagues issued search alerts. Several days later, her body was found under circumstances that are still under investigation.
> 
> According to the Silueta X organization's registry, 12 transfemicides were documented in Ecuador in 2025, 8 of which specifically affected trans women. These data reflect the persistence of structural violence and the vulnerability of this population to lethal attacks in different regions of the country.
> 
> In an interview with this media outlet, Odalys Cayambe , leader and head of the ksatransec project, explained that Kendra came from a conflict-ridden area of ??Guayaquil and had been the victim of various episodes of violence.
> 
> “She was fleeing a very dangerous area where her brothers were murdered and her family had to leave,” Cayambe said.
> 
> Kendra arrived at Casa Trans several years ago. There, in addition to receiving support, she actively participated in cultural and social awareness initiatives such as voguing and Afrotransfeminism.
> 
>  “Beyond being part of the project, she was a territorial leader who worked hard,” Cayambe added.
> 
> The leader also indicated that Kendra is not the first case of murders of trans women in high-risk contexts in Ecuador, especially in peripheral areas affected by organized crime.
> 
> "Every month we bury a daughter. Many of our comrades have been murdered or disappeared, and there's no official record of all the cases," she said.
> 
> Trans and LGBTIQ+ organizations have repeatedly denounced the lack of protection measures and access to justice. Cayambe asserts that there is "multiple evidence" of violence against trans women in peripheral areas of Guayaquil and other cities, but that the complaints have not received sufficient responses from the authorities.
> 
> Casa Trans, a space managed by @ksatransec, provides assistance to trans people in vulnerable situations: food support, temporary shelter, and medical support. They are currently organizing a fundraising campaign to cover Kendra Cabeza's funeral expenses.
> 
> Odalys Cayambe expressed her grief over the loss of one of her members and requested support to cover Kendra's funeral expenses. Donations can be made to the following bank account:

> Kendra Cabeza joined Casa Trans at age 14. She finished high school and became a community leader. Activists consider her death a new blow to the trans community, which faces high rates of violence and social exclusion.
> 
> As the investigations progress, ksatransec has reiterated its call to society and authorities to make these cases visible, ensure the protection of trans people, and properly record the figures for violence in order to generate effective public policies.
 
 
 
>  According to preliminary reports, the body of a lifeless person, in an advanced state of decomposition and missing limbs, was found on Casuarinas Avenue, in the area known as the Canal de la Muerte (Death Canal), an area sadly infamous for its accumulation of victims of extreme violence in our city. Kendra was initially reported missing. Although there are few confirmed notes or details so far due to the sensitive and ongoing nature of the investigation, preliminary evidence and the context of her recent disappearance point to a possible transfemicide motivated by transphobic and racist hatred. Kendra, like many Afro-descendant trans women in Ecuador, faced daily intersectional discrimination, social exclusion, and extreme risks stemming from her gender identity and ethnic origin.
