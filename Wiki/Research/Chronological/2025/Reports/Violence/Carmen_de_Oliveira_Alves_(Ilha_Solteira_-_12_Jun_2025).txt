murdered




> The São Paulo Civil Police arrested two men suspected of involvement in the disappearance and possible murder of 25-year-old transgender student Carmen de Oliveira Alves. The young woman, a Zootechnics student at São Paulo State University (Unesp) in Ilha Solteira, São Paulo, was last seen alive on June 12, when she left campus on a black electric bicycle. Her whereabouts have remained unknown ever since.
> 
> Investigations indicate that Carmen was murdered on Valentine's Day, the date she disappeared. According to the police chief in charge of the case, Miguel Rocha, the crime was allegedly committed by Marcos Yuri Amorim, the victim's boyfriend at the time and also a student at Unesp. He allegedly had the assistance of Roberto Carlos de Oliveira, a reserve environmental police officer and Marcos's alleged lover.
> 
> According to the police, Carmen pressured her boyfriend to go public with their relationship. Marcos, however, refused to acknowledge the affair. This tension, according to the investigation, motivated the crime. Furthermore, Carmen had compiled a dossier containing evidence that her boyfriend was involved in theft and other illegal behavior. This file was allegedly deleted by Marcos on the same day he disappeared.

> 
> According to the mother's report to the police, the day before her disappearance, on Wednesday (11), around 11 pm, the young woman left home with a black electric bicycle. Her bicycle was not found. Family members also claim that Carmen had never disappeared before.
> 
> After the incident,  family and friends helped the police in the search  and held several demonstrations demanding answers in the case.
> 
> Among the  locations searched was the area near the city's river , where Carmen's cell phone signal was last picked up. A search was also conducted in a wooded area near the university, where tire tracks matching those of the electric bicycle she was using at the time of her disappearance were found.
> 
> Carmen is approximately 1.70 meters tall, has curly black hair, dark skin, and brown eyes. Anyone with information about the young woman's whereabouts can contact the police at 190 or 181. G1




> The 29 days since Carmen's disappearance have been a pilgrimage for her family. They've roamed streets, forests, and the banks of streams, rivers, and creeks in search of clues to their whereabouts.
> 
> "Ilha Solteira is a city surrounded by rich wildlife and rivers. So far, there has been no mobilization of diving teams, nor any information about more in-depth searches," says Lucas Alves, the student's brother.
> 
> Gerson Alves, her father, says he needs to know where his daughter's body is to find peace. Heartbroken, he's grateful for the progress made in the investigation and all the mobilization in the city, and asks that Carmen "never be forgotten."
> 
> Carmen's case also mobilized UNESP. Many colleagues helped the families in the search. Fear, however, kept other parts of the city away.
> 
> This is what Isadora Schumaher, vice president of the animal science academic center, reports. "It feels like a movie, unfortunately with a somewhat macabre feel." She was one of the people who left Ilha Solteira due to the "anguish of being home alone" amid the mystery surrounding Carmen's disappearance.
