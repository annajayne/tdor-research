> 
> Although the Attorney General's Office has made progress in investigations related to these crimes, the Ombudsman's Office emphasized that impunity remains one of the main challenges in ensuring justice in these cases.
> 
> According to the organization, the lack of effective sanctions and weak institutional responses perpetuate violence against LGBTIQ+ people in Colombia.
> 
> The Ombudsman's report not only highlights the seriousness of the murders that occurred in January, but also reveals a pattern of systematic violence affecting the LGBTQ+ community in Colombia.
>
