> Comunidad LGBTQ+ confirma y condena hallazgo de mujer trans sin vida dentro de tambo en Coatzacoalcos | VIDEO
> The body found in a 200-liter drum abandoned on a vacant lot in Ciudad Olmeca in Coatzacoalcos was confirmed to be that of a member of the LGBTQ+ community , making it the second hate crime recorded in 2025 in the southern part of Veracruz.
> 
> "Yes, we know she's a trans woman," revealed Luis Giovanni Pérez, president of the Ambien-Tales Collective for Sexual Diversity, who called on authorities to investigate and ensure this crime is not left unpunished. 
> 
> THE FACTS
> It was Monday morning that police authorities were alerted to the discovery of a person's body in a plastic drum on a lot located next to Quetzalcóatl Street between Mesoamérica and Río Grijalva. 
> 
> The body was found inside the container, with its hands and feet tied , as well as possible signs of violence and the clothing being women's clothing.
> 
> The police report established that her biological sex was being referred to, but it was ultimately confirmed that the victim was a trans woman, who remains unidentified.
> 
> THE SECOND CASE IN THE REGION SO FAR THIS YEAR
> In this regard, the representative of the sexual diversity collective explained that this hate crime is the second such case  in southern Veracruz , while it is the fifth in the entire state.
> 
> "The way they are sometimes treated on social media generates hate speech toward people in the LGBTQ + community. For example, in hospitals, when a trans woman goes to the doctor, they don't know how to treat her. The same thing happens when a lesbian woman goes to the doctor; they don't know how to treat her," she said.
> 
> Finally , she lamented that trans women continue to be subjected to mistreatment and discrimination when they seek out public health services , as medical personnel do not know how to treat them, nor do any other services, and society does not know how to deal with them and they tend to be victims of discrimination.
