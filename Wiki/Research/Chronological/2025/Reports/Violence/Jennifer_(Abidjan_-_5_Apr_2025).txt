> Transfemicide in Abidjan shakes Ivory Coast
> She had fled from transphobic violence in Benin.
> On the night of April 4 to 5, a trans woman known as Jennifer was murdered in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, after fleeing from her native Benin, where she was the victim of a transphobic assault.  Now she has become one of the latest fatalities in an ongoing epidemic of transgender murders that totaled at least 350 worldwide in 2024.

> 
> Jennifer, age 23, had been living in Ivory Coast for four years after fleeing her native Benin after she was  assaulted in a bar there and stripped naked in public. Since 2021, she had thought she had found a relative haven of peace in Ivory Coast, where she could enjoy her trans identity in peace, far from the inquisitive eyes of her family.
> 
> Until recently, Ivory Coast had been seen as relatively tolerant towards LGBT people, but that image has been shattered by a wave of anti-LGBT hate speech and violence.
> 
> Jennifer’s murder is evidence of a “silent and dangerous” homophobia that infects Ivory Coast, in the words of  Guadalupe Diakhoumpa (pseudonym), a Senegalese activist who has lived in Abidjan.
> 
> Facts in Abidjan
> According to those close to Jennifer, she apparently met her murderer on a social network, but had taken precautions before meeting him. She told him beforehand that she was a trans woman in order to avoid any misunderstanding.
> 
> She also avoided going out at night to meet him in an unfamiliar neighborhood. Instead, she arranged to meet him at her home.
> 
> However, on the night of April 4-5, she was found lifeless in her home, stabbed to death and lying in a pool of blood.
> 
> Before the tragedy, feeling the need to be proactive, she had taken care to send close friends a photo of the young man she was about to meet. As a result, after the murder, the identity of her assailant was quickly revealed on the web.

> Reactions in Ivory Coast
> For the time being, the authorities have not commented, and the judicial investigation by the Ivorian authorities is continuing.
> 
> In his defense, the young man in question is claiming self-defense against an intimidating and sexually demanding trans woman who tried to force him to consent to a sexual act against his will.
> 
> For Jennifer’s friends, this is nothing less than a “murder”, a “premeditated transfeminicide”.
> 
> The case, which will be closely scrutinized by the West African LGBT+ community, is due to be decided by the courts in the near future, and has already had repercussions beyond the borders of Ivory Coast, notably in the Jennifer’s country of origin.
