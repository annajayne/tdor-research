> Satna/Kanpur3 hours ago
> 
> In a shocking turn to the Kanpur double murder case, the prime accused, 30-year-old Akash Vishwakarma, was found dead in a Satna hotel in Madhya Pradesh on Monday. He had fled after allegedly killing transgender Kajal and her 12-year-old cousin, Dev, in Kanpur. Satna SP Ashutosh Gupta confirmed that UP Police has been informed of the suicide.
> 
> Kolgawan Police Station in-charge Sudeep Soni revealed that a suicide note was found in Akash’s trouser pocket. In it, Akash admitted to killing the two victims, claiming they had been harassing and blackmailing him. He stated that he was taking his own life voluntarily.
> 
> Hotel stay before death
> 
> Akash had checked into a hotel at Semaria Chowk on Saturday, booking room number 27. On Sunday evening, he checked out to head for the railway station but returned after missing his train, booking the same room again. On Monday afternoon, hotel cleaning staff noticed no activity and alerted the management, who then informed police. The police opened the room with a duplicate key and found Akash hanging from a curtain-made noose.
> 
> Initial investigations indicate Akash was distressed due to alleged blackmail by Kajal. Police say Kajal disliked being called transgender and underwent facial surgery in Mumbai for ₹5 lakh to enhance her appearance as a woman. In her murder case, Kajal’s mother had named Akash, along with two others—Alok alias Golu and Hemraj alias Ajay, as suspects.
> 
> Police findings suggest Kajal had relationships with both Alok and Akash, while Hemraj, the partner of Kajal’s associate Devika, was also vying for her attention. Akash had allegedly paid Kajal ₹5 lakh as an advance for a land purchase, but their relationship soured. Unable to break free from her, Akash allegedly killed Kajal and Dev before taking his own life.
