> RENÉ, VÍCTIMA DE SICARIATO EN SAN PEDRO: ¡BASTA DE IMPUNIDAD CONTRA TRANS!
> The Silueta X Association, in alliance with the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI+ Organizations and the National Trans Platform "CoaliTrans", indignantly denounces the information from the Chicas Trans Ruta Spondylus Collective about the murder of a trans woman in the province of Santa Elena.
> 
> On Thursday, June 26, in the San Pedro commune, north of Santa Elena, a violent incident ended the life of a member of the LGBTI community known as René (pseudonym, Runa Sipiy code SX-SAN-25061226), according to preliminary information. The police were immediately alerted, and investigations are ongoing to clarify this crime that has shocked the town. The Runa Sipiy Report by Silueta X records this case as part of the alarming wave of transfemicides in 2025, demanding that the State Attorney General's Office, the National Police, and the Ministry of Women and Human Rights carry out an immediate and thorough investigation.
> 
> René, known by the pseudonym Runa Sipiy in the report, was a young trans woman whose life was marked by adversity from childhood. She stood out for her beauty and charisma, which won over teachers and classmates at Colegio Manglaralto around 2002, where she studied for two years before facing family problems that led her to San Pedro. Protected by her general inspector, who became her friend and defender, René returned home after legal proceedings in Guayaquil, always displaying gratitude and the innocent smile that characterized her. A month ago, in a final conversation in Valdivia, she was warned against keeping bad company, but she was shot dead on June 26, 2025, in the San Pedro commune, leaving a legacy of resilience and a deep void in those who knew her.
