> At Caribe Afirmativo, we deeply regret the confirmation of the discovery of Tailyn Valencia's lifeless body in Medellín, Antioquia. The incident occurred in the Los Ángeles neighborhood, in downtown Medellín, Colombia, which belongs to Commune 10, La Candelaria. Tailyn becomes the 18th LGBTIQ+ victim so far in 2025.
> 
> We express our solidarity with his family, friends, and community, who are currently facing irreparable pain. This incident, in addition to being a personal tragedy, is a reflection of the human rights crisis that continues to affect LGBTIQ+ people and historically vulnerable populations in Colombia. The persistence of violence demands a strong and urgent response from us as a society.
> 
> We urge the authorities to ensure a diligent, thorough, and transparent investigation that will clarify the facts and identify those responsible for this crime. It is essential that, during the investigation, Directive 006 of the Attorney General's Office be implemented to determine whether the crime was motivated by prejudice against a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression.
> 
> At Caribe Afirmativo, we will continue to denounce these acts of violence and work for a society where the life and dignity of all people are respected. We call on state institutions, civil society, and the international community to not remain indifferent to the systematic violence that continues to claim lives.


> A trans woman was found dead inside a residence in the Los Ángeles neighborhood of the La Candelaria commune, in the center of the city.  
> 
> The victim, aged between 30 and 40, had multiple injuries caused by a blunt object, and his body was found tied up. The circumstances surrounding this tragic event and the identity of those responsible are being investigated by the competent authorities. 
> 
> This crime has caused dismay in the community and has raised concerns among defenders of the rights of the trans population in Medellín. It is hoped that the authorities will move quickly in the investigation to clarify the facts and bring those responsible to justice. 
> 
> In another incident, in the municipality of Caucasia, another trans woman was also murdered when a man forced open the door and shot her several times. The victim, Sheik Oliveros Quintana, 30 years old and a member of the LGTBIQ+ community, was found with multiple injuries.
