> Realizan misa en la glorieta de Las y Los Desaparecidos: “estoy desesperada como todas las mamás”
> More than 100 people gathered on March 14 at the Las y Los Desaparecidos roundabout, a place that has become a symbol of the pain of hundreds of families still searching for their loved ones, with no clear answers from the authorities.
> 
> The mass was a space to share stories of anguish, like those of Silvia Ramos, Norma Elizabeth Talamantes, and Joaquín Vera, who expressed their pain and frustration at the lack of progress in the search for their missing relatives.
> 
> Testimonies of relatives of missing persons
> Silvia Ramos, mother of Carlos Yamir Chávez Ramos , who disappeared on October 8, 2023, recounted the anguishing event that marked her life. 
> 
> "I'm looking for my son, Carlos Yamir Chávez Ramos, also known as Jennifer Michelle Chávez. He disappeared on October 8, 2023, in the agricultural colony. He was with my stepson, and supposedly, armed men intercepted them as they were coming back from the store. They only released my stepson, but not my son," she explained between sobs.
> He highlighted the authorities' inaction, noting that the Prosecutor's Office has done nothing to clarify his case: " As always, they never do anything . The prosecutor's office only went there two or three times, and they never came back," he said.
> 
> Norma Elizabeth Talamantes is searching for her son José Rigoberto Vega Talamantes , who disappeared on July 11, 2024.
> 
> "He went to the store and never came back. My other son told me because he lived with his brother. I haven't heard from him since," Norma said, visibly distressed.
> 
> The desperation of the mothers experiencing this tragedy is reflected in their words.
> 
> "It's been eight months, and there's no progress in the case. I'm desperate, like all mothers. I wish I knew something."
> The lack of information and action on the part of the authorities creates profound pain and a sense of abandonment among the affected families.
> 
> For his part, Joaquín Vera is searching for his brother, engineer Bernardo Daniel Vera Vargas, who disappeared on January 3 of this year in the Villa Guerrero neighborhood.
> 
> "They called him in for a car repair and he never came back," Joaquín recounted. Despite the seriousness of the case, progress in the investigation has been nil. "There's been absolutely nothing, no report, no authorities have come to us. We've had to search on our own," he expressed frustration.
