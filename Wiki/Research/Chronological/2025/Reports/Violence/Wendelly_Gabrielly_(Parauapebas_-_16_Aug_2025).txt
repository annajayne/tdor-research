> Police investigate the death of a trans woman, and prejudiced comments on social media raise alarm

> A 22-year-old woman was found dead in Carajás Park, in Parauapebas; Civil Police Section conducts investigations as the debate on transphobia grows
> 
> On the night of last Saturday (16), around 9:20 pm, a trans woman was found dead inside a residence located on Rua Ticuna, in the Parque dos Carajás neighborhood, in Parauapebas, southeast of Pará.
> 
> The victim was identified as Wendelly Gabrielly ( cachinhos_g1w ), 22 years old, who identified as a trans woman. The body showed signs of mechanical asphyxiation and was found with a cloth wrapped around her neck.
> 
> The Military Police were called by residents who noticed the situation and, upon arrival, confirmed the death. The area was cordoned off until the arrival of the Civil Police and the Forensic Medical Institute (IML), who carried out the necessary procedures.
> 
> The case is being handled by the 20th Civil Police Section of Parauapebas, which has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the death. So far, the perpetrator or motive for the crime has not been determined.
> 
> According to preliminary information, the young woman worked as a call girl. Investigations are seeking to determine whether the homicide may be linked to a possible transphobic crime or other factors.
> 
> After news of the death broke, malicious and prejudiced comments about the victim began to circulate on social media.
> 
> The Pebinha de Açúcar Portal team emphasizes that this type of demonstration, besides being disrespectful, constitutes a crime. In 2019, the Supreme Federal Court (STF) ruled that homophobia and transphobia should be classified under Law No. 7,716/1989, which addresses crimes resulting from racial or color-based prejudice. In other words, hate speech against LGBTQIA+ people is punished in the same way as racism, with penalties ranging from one to five years in prison, plus a fine.
> 
> It is important to emphasize that freedom of expression does not give anyone the right to attack, humiliate or dehumanize people because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.
> 
> The death of the young trans woman leaves a mystery that the Civil Police will have to unravel, but it also exposes another reality: the prejudice still rooted in society.
> 
> Parauapebas, like Brazil, needs to advance not only in combating physical violence against LGBTQIA+ people, but also against symbolic and verbal violence, which contributes to the exclusion, fear and vulnerability of this population.
> 
> Pebinha de Açúcar will continue to follow the case and reinforces the importance of a serious and responsible debate about respect, dignity, and human rights.
