> 
> Trans woman found dead in Tacna hostel
> According to initial reports, the incident occurred in the morning hours of Sunday, May 18, at the Los 5 Titos hostel, located at the intersection of calles Arias and Aragüez. Under these circumstances, Marcial Eustaquio Paucara Cora (48), a transgender person, got out of a taxi accompanied by a man wearing a mustard jacket and carrying a white bag.
> 
> The two then entered the hostel and went to one of the rooms. The hotel's security cameras captured every movement of Paucara Cora and her companion. After more than two hours, the suspect left the room, behaving suspiciously, and quickly left the property.
> 
> As night fell, the quartermaster approached the bedroom. After knocking several times and receiving no response, he entered, discovering a truly terrifying scene: the trans woman was lying in bed, her face lifeless.
> 
> Alerted by what he had found, he immediately called the authorities. Shortly after, police officers and forensic experts arrived at the hostel and proceeded with the necessary investigation. In the room, they found liquor bottles and other supplies that the occupants had allegedly consumed. A prosecutor later ordered the removal of the body.
> 
> Among the initial findings obtained by the regional morgue, it was learned that the autopsy performed on Marcial Paucara's body revealed the causes of his unfortunate death. The report established that his death was the result of mechanical asphyxiation due to compression of the upper respiratory tract, thus confirming that this was a murder.
> 
> For this reason, the police are evaluating camera footage to track down the possible whereabouts of the man who fled, as he is currently the prime suspect in the crime. The Public Prosecutor's Office has begun the necessary investigation to locate him.
> 
> Relatives of the trans woman, who was found dead at the hostel where she was staying, expressed their grief over what happened. "She was a lonely person, with no problems with anyone," said one of her sisters, who also demanded justice and the full force of the law for whoever is responsible for this crime.
