> Charlene was born on March 6, 1968, in Brookhaven, Mississippi, to Jane Smith and the late Charles Cook. Growing up in Oxford, Charlene earned her Associate’s Degree from Northwest Community College. She cherished days spent swimming at the lake, and quiet moments spent sitting in the sand watching the sunrises and sunsets. These peaceful moments spent in nature always provided Charlene with a sense of calm that she’d carry with her long after she’d left. She held a love for animals, especially her cats and dogs, who all seemed to be drawn to her gentle and loving nature. A lover of music, Charlene was a talented guitarist who enjoyed practicing her craft and learning new chords. When she wasn’t listening to music, she loved to get lost in a good book. Charlene held her family and friends dear to her heart, expressing her love for them often through small acts, like picking small bouquets of flowers to gift to them. She was preceded in death by her father, Charles Cook.
> 
> Charlene is survived by her mother, Jane Reifers, and beloved step-father, Garry Reifers, of Oxford, Mississippi; daughter, Devin Cook (Matthew) of Paducah, Kentucky; son, Adam Cook (Angela) of Colorado Springs, Colorado; sister, Amy Geiger of Oxford, Mississippi; and two grandchildren, Walter and Oscar.
