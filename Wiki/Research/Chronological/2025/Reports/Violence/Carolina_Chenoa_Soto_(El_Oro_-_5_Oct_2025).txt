> The discovery of the body of Carolina Chenoa Soto, a 50-year-old hairstylist, shocked residents of downtown Machala in El Oro on Sunday, October 5.
> 
> The victim, who identified as a transgender woman, was found dead inside her home and beauty salon on calle Guayas, between calles Boyacá and Pasaje, in Machala, El Oro . Police officers arrived at the scene following an ECU-911 alert issued by neighbors who had noticed her absence for several days.
> 
> In the bedroom, the victim was found surrounded by blood, next to a knife. Initially, it was believed she had been attacked with a knife, but forensic experts ruled out stab wounds, and the case was treated as an undetermined death.
> 
> The autopsy performed on October 6 at the Machala Forensic Center confirmed the cause of death as strangulation. No serious external injuries were found, suggesting that she was attacked with no opportunity to defend herself.
> 
> Machala District Chief Luis Suárez stated that no signs of a struggle or robbery were found, leading to the assumption that she knew her attacker. Carolina was a well-known member of the LGBTI community in El Oro. Activists demanded a gender-sensitive investigation to determine whether this was a hate crime.
