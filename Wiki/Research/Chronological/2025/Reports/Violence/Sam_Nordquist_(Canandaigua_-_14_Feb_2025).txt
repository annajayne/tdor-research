> CANANDAIGUA, NY (AP) — New York State Police charged five people Friday with the murder of a missing man who authorities say died after repeated acts of violence and torture over more than a month by multiple people who then dumped his body in a field.
> 
> The victim, Sam Nordquist, a 24-year-old transgender man from Minnesota, was reported missing on Feb. 9. Police said he arrived in New York in September and had lost contact with loved ones.
> 
> Maj. Kevin Sucher, commander of the state police troop that includes the Finger Lakes region, said the facts and circumstances of the case were “beyond depraved” and “by far the worst” homicide investigation the office has been a part of.

> 
> “No human being should have to endure what Sam endured,” he said during the televised news conference. Police did not share many details of the case, noting that it remained under active investigation.
> 
> Asked whether the torture and killing of Nordquist was considered a hate crime, Capt. Kelly Swift, New York State Troop E Bureau of Criminal Investigation, said police had not ruled it out, but stressed that the investigation was continuing. Investigators must also determine Nordquist's relationship to the suspects, as well as the suspects' relationships to each other.
> 
> Those arrested include Precious Arzuaga, 38, and Patrick Goodwin, 30, of Canandaigua, New York; Kyle Sage, 33, of Rochester, New York; Jennifer Quijano, 30, of Geneva, New York; and Emily Motyka, 19, of Limaton, New York. All five were charged with second-degree murder after police searched a room Thursday at the Patty's Lodge Motel in Canandaigua, where Nordquist was known to be staying.
> 
> All five were being held in police custody pending arraignment. It was not clear whether any had obtained a lawyer.
> 
> So far, the investigation has revealed a “deeply disturbing pattern” that ultimately resulted in Nordquist's death, said Swift, who called it “one of the most horrific crimes” he has ever investigated in his 20-year law enforcement career.




> Farmington, N.Y. (WHAM) — Five people face murder charges after a transgender man reported missing in Ontario County was found dead in a field in Yates County, apparently after enduring months of torture, according to authorities.
> 
> "In my 20-year law enforcement career, this is one of the most horrific crimes I have ever investigated," New York State Police Captain Kelly Swift said.
> 
> New York State Police said Sam Nordquist, 24, of Oakdale, Minnesota, arrived in New York state in September and was staying at Patty's Lodge in Hopewell. He was last in contact with loved ones in late January and was last seen earlier this month.
> 
> Police launched a missing person investigation Sunday after receiving a welfare check request from Nordquist's family. They determined Nordquist had been staying at Patty's Lodge with Precious Arzuaga, 38, of Geneva, and others.
> 
> Swift said Nordquist "endured prolonged physical and psychological abuse" and "repeated acts of violence and torture" between early December and early February.
> 
> According to a felony complaint, the suspects sexually assaulted Nordquist with a table leg and broomsticks, and beat him with sticks, dog toys, ropes and belts until he died. His body "was then transported in an attempt to conceal the crime," Swift said during a press conference Friday at the New York State Police Troop E headquarters in Farmington.
> 
> Swift said police executed a search warrant Thursday inside Apartment 22 at Patty's Lodge. They found Nordquist's body Thursday in a field off Payne Road in the town of Benton.
> 
> Arzuaga and four other suspects were arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
> 
> Kyle Sage, 33, of Hopewell
> Patrick Goodwin, 30, of Rochester
> Emily Motyka, 19, of Rochester
> Jennifer Quijano, 30, of Geneva
> The five suspects were arraigned overnight and are being held in the Ontario County Jail without bail. District Attorney Jim Ritts said he anticipates grand jury action "very quickly."
> 
> "The facts and the circumstances of this crime are beyond depraved," Ritts said. "This is by far the worst homicide investigation that our office has ever been a part of. It is an ongoing investigation, so we are necessarily limited in the things that we can talk about. But no human being should have to endure what Sam endured."
> 
> Michelle Pickard, who lives in Farmington and assisted with the search effort, said Nordquist's heartbroken family is on the way from Minnesota and called the details of the case "sickening."
> 
> "Sam’s a human being, a beautiful one, and it’s just unfortunate that people are that disgusting and that ugly," she said.
> 
> Nordquist's death remains under investigation. Police said the Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death.
> 
> Swift said authorities haven't ruled out the potential of a hate crime in the case. Ritts said they're asking for patience as they work through the case.
> 
> "We will work, and we will work tirelessly," Ritts said. "We will continue to work with our partners in law enforcement to make sure this investigation moves — and that we move forward appropriately so that the family can have closure."



> UPDATE - Tragically, Sam was found deceased. 
> 4 people are in custody for the horrific news. 
> Sam, a transgender male from Oakdale, Minnesota, met a woman named Precious online, who convinced him to visit her in New York. Sam left Minnesota on September 28, 2024, with a round-trip plane ticket, planning to return within two weeks. However, he never boarded his return flight and was unreachable for 24 hours. Since then, Precious has been controlling Sam, to the point that he even reported it to the local DSS. DSS has not heard from Sam since December, and when his family calls, his phone goes straight to voicemail. On February 9, a welfare check was conducted. Precious' son answered the door, claiming Sam was not there, had never been there, and that he didn't know who the officer was asking about. The officer then returned to Precious' last known location, where she claimed Sam left several weeks ago and no longer lived there. Sam had never been to New York before September 28, 2024.
