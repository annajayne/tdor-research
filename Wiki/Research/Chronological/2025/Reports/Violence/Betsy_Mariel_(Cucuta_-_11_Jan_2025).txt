> For this reason, the authorities believe that the hitmen were targeting Odilia, since the house was her property and was used for the consumption and sale of hallucinogens, but they killed Betsy because she was there by chance.
> 
> The newspaper La Opinión de Cúcuta reported that Odilia's son saw the man who allegedly shot the two people in the living room of his home, but he did not find the suspicious subject, since he had already seen him enter the house on two occasions, so he welcomed him and even asked him if he had brought him cigarettes or anything else from the store.

> "Consumers came into the house to 'snitch' inside and talk to my mother. I saw the killer twice and I said it was him because when I returned he was no longer there," the relative told La Opinión reporters.
> 
> Authorities reported that the house where the double murder occurred was a so-called “olla” (pot) so they believe the death could have been due to a settlement of scores or revenge.
