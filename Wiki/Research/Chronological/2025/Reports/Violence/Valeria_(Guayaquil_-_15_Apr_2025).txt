> The Silueta X Association, a member of the Ecuadorian Federation of LGBTI+ Organizations, denounces with profound indignation and pain the brutal murder of a trans woman, whom we will refer to by the pseudonym Valeria, to protect her identity and dignity. This crime, which occurred on the night of April 15, 2025, on 40th and K streets, near the Emilio Murillo school, in the suburb of Guayaquil, constitutes a transfemicide that demonstrates the systematic violence against trans people in Ecuador.
> 
> According to the information gathered, Valeria was shot and killed by gunmen who arrived on a motorcycle and fired a volley of bullets at her. This act of extreme violence not only took her life but also reflects the hatred and intolerance toward diverse gender identities. Furthermore, we deeply regret that, in initial reports, Valeria's gender identity was violated by referring to her in the masculine, perpetuating a form of revictimization that denies her existence as a trans woman.
