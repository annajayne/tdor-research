> ARAME - The Civil Police are investigating the murder of a 21-year-old trans indigenous woman, identified as Rubi, who was stabbed to death on Monday morning (29), in the municipality of Arame. The body was found around 9 am, on the banks of the MA-006, on the stretch that connects Arame to Grajaú.
> 
> Victim was known in the community
> According to reports from residents, Rubi was well-known in the area, lived in an indigenous community, and had a habit of walking along the highway. Witnesses said drivers frequently offered her a ride, but she always refused. The crime, committed with multiple stab wounds, shocked residents with its brutality.





> Assassinato de Rubi: qual será a reação ao transfeminicídio e ao racismo? - Agência Tambor
> Marquinhos, the transphobic councilman, is an ally of Governor Carlos Brandão
> 
> How will Maranhão society respond to the barbaric murder of Rubi, which occurred just a few days ago? She was an Indigenous trans woman.
> 
> To seek answers, let us remember: on April 15 of this year, the City Council of São Luís, capital of Maranhão, approved a bill that encourages misinformation, prejudice, hatred and violence against trans women.
> 
> According to this illegal and absurd proposal, trans women in São Luís would not be able to use women's restrooms. There were occasional reactions from the State Public Defender's Office, members of parliament, and social organizations. Today, this issue—related to a law that encourages crime and barbarity—is hushed up.
> 
> It is important to remember this legislative attempt from the capital of Maranhão when we talk about Rubi, the victim of a heinous crime associated with deep structural problems—in this specific case, a transfemicide with clear traces of racism.
> 
> Who remembers Shakira?
> 
> Last Monday (29/09), Rubi's body was found on the banks of the MA-006, in the municipality of Arame, 476 km from São Luís. The city has only 25 thousand inhabitants. The young woman was murdered with stab wounds.
> 
> Rubi's murder is a heinous crime.
> The oligarchic media cartel of Maranhão reported the case following the old pattern of turning blood into a commodity. Soon after, a deafening silence set in—an institutional muteness—revealing the state's complicity in violent practices associated with exclusion and discrimination.
> 
> On the other hand, Rubi's case provoked deep indignation and repudiation in specific sectors (including outside Maranhão).
> 
> There is a need for social pressure to prevent impunity, in addition to the urgent need for more public policies — including educational ones — to combat racism, transphobia, and gender-based violence.
> 
> The issue demands visibility. However, judging by the state capital itself, if the status quo in Maranhão is maintained, this will be just another episode incorporated into the old, undesirably naturalized landscape.
> 
> The Maranhão government, currently led by agribusinessman Carlos Brandão, needs to be pressured to act with rigor, honesty, and transparency, adopting concrete measures to prevent any possibility of impunity or manipulation of the investigation.
> 
> It's worth remembering that, in April 2025, a 23-year-old Indigenous transvestite named Shakira was found dead in the municipality of Grajaú. Her body was found floating in a nearby river. She was from the Cocal village. According to the official version, Shakira "died by drowning."
> 
> In April of this year, indigenous Shakira was found dead
> Brutal conservatism
> 
> The challenge of reacting to the stabbings inflicted on Rubi becomes even more evident when we note that the current Secretary of State for Women is Abigail Cunha, a state deputy from the Liberal Party (PL).
> 
> Abigail has already been accused of racism by organizations representing domestic workers, after publishing a post on her social media alongside black women who worked in her home.
> 
> Furthermore, the same deputy/secretary maintains an open political alliance with a mayor convicted of rape, affiliated with the same PL as Bolsonarism.
> 
> Abigail Cunha, Secretary of State for Women in the Brandão government, is an ally of Cirineu Costa, the mayor convicted of rape.
> As for the transphobic bill approved this year by the São Luís City Council, it was authored by councilman Marquinhos (União Brasil), another extremist, an ally of current governor Carlos Brandão.
> 
> The same week Rubi's body was found, Councilman Marquinhos posted a photo alongside the governor on his Instagram, with the following caption: "I have the honor to reaffirm my deep admiration and respect for Governor Carlos Brandão."
> 
> According to the transphobic parliamentarian, the current government of Maranhão “has transformed lives, bringing real advances in job creation, health, fighting hunger, education, infrastructure, security…”.
> 
> Commitment and sensitivity?
> 
> In Maranhão, in addition to the State Secretariat for Women, there are also Secretariats for Racial Equality and Human Rights and Popular Participation. The existence of these structures alone represents an institutional advancement.
> 
> The question is: is there any real commitment, any minimal sensitivity, among the people who truly run the Maranhão government to address the issues that affect cis and trans women? Indigenous and Black women?
> 
> As they say in our rural communities in Maranhão, we hope that Rubi becomes a seed—and that her memory strengthens the fight against transphobia, racism, sexism, and all forms of violence that continue to kill in this state.
> 
> What the government says
> 
> The Civil Police of Maranhão (PC-MA), through the Arame Police Station, informs that it is investigating Rubi's murder.
> 
> According to the government, "teams from the Civil Police and Military Police are carrying out investigations with the aim of collecting evidence to support the investigative work, in order to clarify the circumstances of the crime and identify its perpetrator."
> 
> The PC-MA emphasizes that new information will be passed on as the progress of the investigations allows.
> 
> The State Secretariat for Human Rights and Popular Participation (Sedihpop) reports that, "according to data from the Dossier – Deaths and Violence Against LGBTQIA+ People in Brazil, eight deaths involving LGBTQIA+ people were recorded in Maranhão in 2023. In 2024, there were seven deaths. Data for 2025 is still being compiled."
> 
> Much more than demagoguery, Carlos Brandão needs commitment and sensitivity to face problems
> Sedihpop reinforces that “any situations of rights violations can be reported to the Human Rights Ombudsman via WhatsApp: (98) 99104-4558”.
> 
> The secretariat states that, with various government initiatives underway, "it continues working to ensure better monitoring of violence against the LGBTQIA+ population, as well as the development of actions to promote citizenship."
> 
> Carlos Brandão's government did not send any information about what was being done by the Secretariats for Women and Racial Equality.
