murdered



> The most recent case occurred in Cali, Valle del Cauca, where Daira Martínez, a trans woman, was murdered, becoming the 53rd victim of this year, according to Caribe Afirmativo.
> 
> Her murder, the circumstances of which have not yet been publicly clarified, sparked a new wave of outrage on social media and among human rights organizations.
> 
> "We deeply regret her murder. We demand a rigorous investigation, with a gender perspective, that guarantees truth, justice, and non-repetition ," Caribe Afirmativo said in a statement. 
> 
> The case was brought to the attention of judicial authorities, and a request was made to prioritize it within investigative processes related to bias-based violence.
> 
> The phenomenon is not new. As CNN en Español reported, "social cleansing" squads have been operating in Colombia for decades and have been used by armed groups to impose their authority and spread fear.
> 
> In Medellín, for example, local gangs, grouped under the alliance known as "La Oficina," control entire neighborhoods where, according to testimonies collected by the outlet, the murders of LGBTQ people serve to reinforce their power and impose authoritarian moral codes.
