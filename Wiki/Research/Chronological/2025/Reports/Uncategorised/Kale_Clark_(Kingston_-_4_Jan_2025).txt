> 
> Kale Clark taught himself to play everything from bass guitar to the harmonica, braved rocky cliffs to harvest wild raspberries for his loved ones, and could captivate a crowd with his stage presence.
> 
> He was so full of passion and personality his families said it's as if he lived multiple lives in the 15 and a half years he spent on Earth.
> 
> "Kale was the kind of kid that jumped right into everything," said his mother, Christina Avery. "He was a really joyous and silly and sassy person, and we're just trying to build his love into our grief."
> 
> On Jan. 4, Kale was at a friend's house for a sleepover. According to Avery, his last words before going for a walk were typical of her child's restless spirit: "I'm bored. Let's go on an adventure."
> 
> Around 5:30 p.m., Kale was struck by a work van along Rosedale Road, about a 30-minute drive north of Kingston.
> 
> Teen dead after being struck by van in South Frontenac Township
> He was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said a second pedestrian was transported to hospital with minor injuries.
> 
> "I feel like he would be a little disappointed that he went out doing something as mundane is walking down the street, because it should have been a motorcycle or skydiving," said Avery. "He was constantly giving me heart attacks."
> 
> Kale was raised by two loving families, both now devastated by his death.

> His father, Dean Clark, said the teen was a "ball of energy" from birth, constantly on the move, learning and growing.
> 
> "There wasn't a bad bone in this kid's body, and there wasn't a challenge that he wouldn't jump into," Clark said. "He's my balance, my compass. I'm lost without him."
> 
> Nathalie Clark, Kale's stepmother, described him as the one of the "kindest, brightest, most courageous little kiddos" whose infectious joy brightened the world for everyone around him.
> 
> His loss has left siblings Oliver, Amelia and Wilder feeling empty, she added.
> 
> Always advocating for others
> Fighting tears, Avery and her partner Radford Cowan said Kale's passions included activism. He took part in animal rights and climate protests from the time he was six.
> 
> That advocacy included an early appearance before city council where he urged stores to keep their doors closed during the summer to conserve air conditioning.
> 
> "He wasn't even tall enough to see over the podium," said Cowan. "All you could see was just this little lump of his head."
> 
> Photos showing smiling people are shown between candles and other mementos.
> Photos of Kale cover the mantle in his mother's bedroom. (Dan Taekema/CBC)
> Avery said Kale was wise beyond his years and continued to fight for others as he grew up.
> 
> "He's been really impassioned by the plight of the Palestinian people, and has participated in ... encampments and protests," she explained.
> 
> In the month before his death, Kale, who was transgender, was prescribed testosterone for the first time, something he'd been waiting years for, the couple said.
> 
> In a world where so many trans folks don't make it to adulthood, they said they know Kale would have been a mentor to others.
> 
> "I just wanted to see him grow up," said Cowan. "That's all I wanted, was just to have him grow up into a big, beautiful, shining star."
> 
> A star on stage
> Among the places where Kale shone brightest was on stage.
> 
> He had "huge plans" for the future, according to Avery, who said the teen was "certain he was going to be the next Elton John."
> 
> Like his idol, Kale was a self-taught musician, learning the flute, keyboard, drums and more.
> 
> A man holds two pieces of paper, one says "Kale" in large green letters, above a drawing of a kale leaf, the other is covered in handwriting, with a small drawing of a carrot.
> Cowan holds letters and cards he and Kale exchanged over the years. He said they've taken on new meaning after the 15-year-old's death. (Dan Taekema/CBC)
> His repertoire included Hot Cross Buns, but with a twist: Avery and Cowan explained Kale had bragged about being able to play the song on three recorders at once — one in each nostril and the third in his mouth.
> 
> In the midst of their mourning, that story has inspired them to try to embrace some of his sense of humour.
> 
> Over the past few days, when the couple has been struggling with sadness, they've started picking up recorders and trying to squeak out the song.
> 
> "It's very hard to continue crying when you are badly playing Hot Cross Buns," said Avery with a smile."Kale would love it, because he always wanted everyone to jam with him, so he would be delighted that so many people are being forced into playing a new instrument."

> The couple has also found other treasures Kale left behind, which have them feeling "wrapped in a beautiful hug." Among them is a birthday card written for Cowan on his 31st birthday.
> 
> "We have family. That means we have joy," it reads in part. "I will always give you the joy you need."
> 
> Avery said the past week has been the most horrific experience Kale's loved ones could have imagined, but at the same time they've felt surrounded by a "ribbon of community love."
> 
> They're also taking comfort in knowing Kale always lived life to the fullest.
> 
> "He got to experience love. He got to experience the stage. He got to play beautiful music. He really had a great last month," said Avery.
> 
> Dean Clark, Kale's father, said the world can't help but be darker without a star like his child's shining so brightly.
> 
> He plans to plant a tree in the backyard — a red oak — as a lasting symbol of Kale's vibrant life.
> 
> "It's the most flamboyant, solid tree that I can imagine," he said.
