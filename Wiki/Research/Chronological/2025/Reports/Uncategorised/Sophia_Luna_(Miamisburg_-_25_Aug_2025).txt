Adjusted obituary:

> Sophia Luna
> 05/13/1992- 08/25/2025
> It is with deep sorrow that we announce the passing of our beloved, Sophia, who left us too soon on 08/25/2025, at the young age of 33.
> 
> Sophia had a heart full of kindness, a recognizable laugh, and a free spirit that never stopped chasing her desires. She was a passionate skateboarder who found freedom on four wheels and could often be found perfecting tricks or cruising through the neighborhood. She also had a deep love for collecting trading cards - from Pokémon to rare finds, each one brought her genuine excitement. A gamer at heart, Sophia spent countless hours immersed in video game adventures, always eager to share a new game or help a friend beat a tough level.
> 
> More than her hobbies, Sophia will be remembered for her loyalty, her big laugh, and the way she always made time for the people she cared about. Whether you knew her for years or just a moment, she left a lasting impression.
