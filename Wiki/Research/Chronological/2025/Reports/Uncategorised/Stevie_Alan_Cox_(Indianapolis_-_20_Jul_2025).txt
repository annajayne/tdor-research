> Stephen Alan "Stevie" Cox, 29, of Indianapolis, IN (formerly of Fairmount, IN), passed away unexpectedly at his home on Sunday, July 20, 2025.
> 
> Stephen was the life of every room he entered-joyful, caring, and endlessly forgiving. His heart was as big as his smile, always ready to uplift others. A proud graduate of Madison-Grant High School, he was deeply involved in theater, serving as President of Argylls and Gals Show Choir during both his junior and senior years. His talent earned him multiple awards and the admiration of his peers.
> 
> A devoted member of the LGBTQ+ community, Stephen was currently serving as President of the Central Indiana LGBTQ+ Young Adults Group, where he was passionate about advocating for sober young queer individuals. He loved attending and watching drag shows-RuPaul was one of his all-time favorite performers.
> 
> Stephen was also grateful for his faith, introduced to him by his beloved mother. He was an active member of St. Luke's United Methodist Church in Indianapolis, where he found community and spiritual growth.
> 
> Stephen earned a Master's Degree in Public Relations from the University of Indianapolis, where he continued to impact students as an Adjunct Faculty Member, Academic Advisor, and Admissions Counselor for the University of Maryland. His work and volunteerism focused on inclusion, education, and compassion-especially for the marginalized and unhoused in the LGBTQ+ community.
> 
> Stephen is survived by his loving mother, Maria Cox Profit, Orange Beach, AL; his sisters, Taneal Bartrum, Marion, IN and Destiny (Zachery) Buckmaster of Bixby, OK; and his adored niece, Charlotte Buckmaster.
