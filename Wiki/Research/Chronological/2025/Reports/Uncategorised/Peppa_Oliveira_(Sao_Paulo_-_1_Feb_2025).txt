> 
> One of the most prolific, beloved, successful, and enduring music producers of modern-day Brazilian pop music, Boss in Drama, was reported dead this Saturday, Feb. 1. The trans artist — who was still navigating her gender journey and transition in recent years — disclosed her name as Peppa Oliveira and was only 37 years old.
> 
> As a DJ and music producer, Boss in Drama was best known for collaborating with rapper Karol Conká. Together, the pair gave us Brazilian queer anthems such as "Saudade," "Farofei," "Lista VIP," and "Toda Doida," to name a few.
> 
> Sources tell Out that Boss in Drama had just been confirmed to perform at an event scheduled for Saturday, March 8, 2025 in Manaus, Brazil. Even though the lineup of the event hadn't yet been revealed, Boss in Drama was booked to perform in it.
> 
> The details of Peppa's death have not been disclosed by friends, family, and loved ones who are mourning her loss and asking for their privacy to be respected.
> 
> Peppa's last Instagram post, shared on Jan. 10, included two selfies and a caption that read, "Now I walk toward the sun, where the light reveals the strength that has always been within me."
> 
> Peppa also shared a series of X (formerly Twitter) posts on Wednesday, Jan. 22 in which she celebrated Conká's performance at the live finale of Dia TV's reality competition show Corrida das Blogueiras: Uma Nova Chance.
> 
> Her main X post about the performance reads (as translated into English):
> 
> "@KarolConka singing our iconic collab "Lista VIP" while the Corrida das Blogueiras finalists walk onto the stage."
> 
> Peppa tagged @DivaDepressao in the post — the gay couple who created Corrida das Blogueiras and have cohosted every single season of the reality series.
> 
> Considering the wide reach, cultural influence, and overall popularity of Boss in Drama as a musician, her death was widely reported by all major news outlets in Brazil that cover show business, such as Rolling Stone Brazil, GQ Brasil, POPline, Glamour Brasil, Veja, G1, Estadão, Hugo Gloss, Metrópolis, Gazeta de S. Paulo, Capricho, SBT News, Quem, Splash UOL, Terra, Istoé, Omelete, Papel Pop, O Tempo, R7, and Correio Braziliense. The list goes on.

> Boss in Drama's most frequent collaborator, Karol Conká, shared an emotional X post mourning the loss of her longtime producer and friend. The rapper wrote (translated from Portuguese):
> 
> "I'm feeling a lot of pain at this moment, and I'd like to ask everyone who had the opportunity to meet, be friends with, work together, learn from, and exchange ideas with Boss to elevate their thoughts, and to remember with great affection and respect, each and every moment we had with our friend."
> 
> "You have no idea how important and meaningful Boss in Drama is in my life," Conká added. "I'm feeling a lot of things right now. I'll always be grateful for having met such a special, intelligent, loving, talented, funny person... I MISS YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU PEPA."
