> I tried to register but my email wouldn't verify so I send this here in hopes that it's added to your list. The person in question is Juno Yoch (Deadname Jameson) who died on the 13th of may due to what we believe to be overdose.
> 
> Due to limited contact with their family we don't know if it was overdose or some other cause but what we do know is that they had a complicated and rarely supportive domestic environment, depression, prior suicide attempts and substance abuse issues, we believe a mixture of factors ranging from transphobia to unsuportive family lead to their early death at the age of 23, they had their whole life ahead of them and I think they could have lead a long and happy life if they had been in a more supportive and loving environment.

> Hello, my name is [redacted] I'm a 25 year old cis gay male from Germany who is writing this email in order to contact you about the passing of a Nonbinary Trans friend of mine named Juno Yoch(They/them/it). They were born on the 14th of April 2002 and died from a likely overdose as they had issues with substance abuse. I sent another email about them earlier today but I don't know if it arrived properly, so I'm just sending this one to make sure.  They were from White Bear Lake, Minnesota and had attempted to take their life in prior occasions but failed, me and other friends had spent the past year trying to motivate them to keep going and attempting to provide support in what ways we could. However due to a complicated home environment, transphobic harassment by former friends and general isolation and loneliness they were in a very fragile state and due to our distance me and most of their online friends could do very little.

> Here is the link to their obituary and a picture of them: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jameson-yoch-obituary?id=58413768
> If you need any additional proof, information or details im happy to provide, we just want them to be remembered as their death was a direct by-product of the pervasive transphobia of American society.


> Thank you for your incredibly quick response. Juno was a very private person and had always been someone who prioritized opsec and peer to peer communication to avoid harassment, doxxing and other such things which have affected trans folks daily, Idk if this could help you further confirm that what I'm saying is true.

> It's the court records of juno being commited by their parents to mental "care" in a psychiatric centre in Saint Paul which had a huge negative mental health impact, i know it's not much and I truly wish I had more but like I said their family kept a low profile, they were a private person and mostly active online.
