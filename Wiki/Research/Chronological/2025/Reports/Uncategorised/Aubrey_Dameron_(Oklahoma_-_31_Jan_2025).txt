> Remains found in rural Ottawa County, Oklahoma, identified as Aubrey Dameron, who vanished nearly 6 years ago
> “Where is she?” 
> 
> It’s a question Christian Fencer has asked many times over the past six years since his niece, Aubrey Dameron, vanished. 
> 
> The 25-year-old was last seen on March 9, 2019, near Grove, part of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.
> 
> “Where is she? I lose hope, but at the same time I see stories of people being found after years of being missing, after months of being missing and I just, I hold on to hope that maybe -- maybe, just maybe, everything will fall into place someday and we’ll get Aubrey back,” Christian told Andrea Canning on Season 1 of the Dateline: Missing in America podcast in 2022.
> 
> Dateline first spoke with Aubrey’s aunt, Pam Smith, in September 2021, who noted the difficulties Aubrey’s case faced. “It’s high-risk to be Native and missing, and high-risk to be transgender and missing,” she said. “And Aubrey was both.” 
> 
> Pam and Christian are Aubrey’s mother Jen Byrd’s siblings. They have acted as spokespeople for the family for more than five years and are spearheading the search for answers. 
> 
> Earlier this week they got one.
> 
> The Quapaw Nation Marshal Service sent out a media release on Wednesday, February 5, 2025, stating that on January 31, they responded to a call “regarding the discovery of human remains located near South 565 Road and East 30 Road, north of Commerce in rural Ottawa County, Oklahoma.” The area is about a 40-minute drive from where Aubrey was last seen. 
> 
> The Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office responded to the scene and collected the remains, which were brought back to the office for further examination and identification. “Due to the condition of the remains, they appeared to have been at the location for an undetermined period of time,” the release states.
> 
> Aubrey DameronPam Smith
> Less than a week after the remains were located, they were positively identified as belonging to Aubrey Dameron. The Marshal Service stated that the family was notified of the identification, and they extended their “sincere condolences to Aubrey’s family and friends as the past six (6) long years of searching for Aubrey has come to an end.” 
> 
> Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. also issued a statement. “After nearly six years missing, our Cherokee Nation citizen Aubrey Dameron has been recovered today. Our thoughts and prayers are with her Aunt Pam and Uncle Christian, who always put Aubrey’s missing persons case, and all MMIP cases, in the forefront where it belonged,” he wrote. “Aubrey, who was extremely proud of her Cherokee culture, had a bright future and her young life was cut too short. Our Marshals led many searches for her, erected billboards to help find her, and helped raise awareness on her case.” 
> 
> Hoskin Jr. finished his statement by saying, “We know her family is in mourning, and Deputy Chief [Bryan Warner] and I, and the entire tribe, offer our condolences and support to her family and friends during this difficult time. Rest in peace dear Aubrey.”   
> 
> On Wednesday, February 5, a post was shared on the Facebook page dedicated to spreading awareness about Aubrey’s case, confirming “that the remains found near Picher are that of Aubrey.” They expressed their gratitude, as well. “Thank you to everyone who has helped along the way. Please give us time to process at this time,” the post reads. 
> 
> The investigation into Aubrey’s death is ongoing. Neither the cause nor manner of death was listed in the media release from the Quapaw Nation Marshal Service.
> 
> Anyone with information about Aubrey’s case is asked to call the Quapaw Nation Marshal Service at 918-238-3137 or Central Dispatch at 918-542-5585. 




> Today I wanted to write about an equally rich personality who sadly had much less luck in life. There are two writeups on Aubrey's case on the sub, but the last one is over a year old so I've figured that it's okay to write about this case again.
> 
> Trigger warning for transphobia
> 
> BACKGROUND
> 
> Aubrey Dameron, also known as "Shorty" by her family, was 25 and was from rural Grove, Oklahoma, USA. Ever since she was a child, she wanted to be a singer and an actress and she absolutely loved music, one of her favorite songs being “You’re the Reason God Made Oklahoma”; Her family didn't have the money to educate her in these fields, but Aubrey was always ready to perform- even if it was just standing on the coffee table and singing for her family.
> 
> Aubrey is a transgender woman who begun her transition in high school. Her classmates would call her slurs and sometimes even threw rocks at her, but Aubrey would tell her family "It's okay, I will keep praying for them". Some local buisnesses also would kick her out for using the women's bathroom and when she and her family were visiting her grandfather in hospice care, a pastor offering family support told her to "stop dressing like a woman" and ordered her to throw her beloved pair of flats into a fireplace in the room. Sobbing, Aubrey threw the shoes into the fire while her family stood silent- her aunt, Pam Smith, sais that she deeply regrets that she didn't stood up for Aubrey that day.
> 
> Aubrey reportedly had "some" gender-affirming medical procedures done, but she hasn't finished the process. She also haven't changed her name in her documents.
> 
> Christian Fencer, Aubrey's uncle (though there was just six months between them in age), deeply misses his niece. He came out as gay to Aubrey, who knew just how to react, what to say and when to stay silent. She could flash him a knowing glance and a homophobic remark didn't hurt as much. They were very close since they were children and were practically siblings.
> 
> 
> Aubrey was a member of the Cherokee Nation. Other than transgender, she also identified as two-spirit, a label used by queer Indigenous Americans that harkens back to pre-colonial traditions related to gender-variant people.
> 
> Her family described her as "A loving and generous woman with a big heart". Her uncle said that Aubrey always wanted to make sure that everyone felt like they belong, and that she was a bit of a mother hen.
> 
> She moved back to Grove, her family home, to live with her mother, brother and stepfather after she left New Mexico on the 18th of August, where she lived with her boyfriend, Jay Pierson, who moved to Colorado. According to Pierson, she chose to move to work on her alcohol and drug addiction, though one article also mentions that she was recovering from a surgery. Her aunt Pam, however, said that Aubrey was afraid of her boyfriend, who allegedly threatened to kill her if she left the relationship- she also said that Aubrey felt like she owed him something, for "everything he did for her".
> 
> Aubrey was always social and posted a lot on social media to stay in contact with her family, but ever since her return home contacting her was difficult, and she rarely posted online.
> 
> Aubrey had seizures for which she took medications.
> 
> DISAPPEARANCE
> 
> Aubrey was last seen on the 9th of March around 3:30 AM as she was leaving her mother's home north of Grove. She messaged a few of her friends asking for a ride, but nobody responded. Her GPS reportedly last “pinged” at 3:42 a.m. on March 9, about 100 yards from her mother’s house. She was reported missing by her mother on the 11th of March. Aubrey has allegedly left the home by her own will and told her family (including brother) that she was "meeting up with a friend". Her social media have been dead silent since then. She left without her medications and purse. Her cell phone pinged the Wi-Fi at a nearby mobile home park, but no one reported seeing her. No doorbell cameras caught Aubrey.
> 
> From the start, the family had to struggle to get the police to investigate anything- Pam Smith remembers that when she talked to Captain Gayle Wells, who handled Aubrey's case, he said that he didn't believe that she was even a missing person due to her "lifestyle". Pam believes that Aubrey was seen as that due to being trans, while Wells insisted that it was because she was a drug abuser and "very sexually active" (I have no idea if he just assumed that or is he basing it off anything).
> 
> On the 12th of March, Deanette Rowbotham, a former close friend of Aubrey, called Jay Pierson and said that Aubrey is being held captive in Ketchum, Oklahoma due to drug debts. Rowbotham said that if the captors won't get the money, they will kill Aubrey, and asked him to contribute and that she will use some of her money too. When police interviewed Rowbotham about the call, she admitted that she made the story up and was charged with extortion. When authorities asked about what she thought happened to Aubrey, she said that she didn't think that she was really missing or that her parents didn't know where really she was.
> 
> Police first decided to check security camera footage and ask the staff of a local casino, the Quapaw Casino, if an alleged sighting of Aubrey on the 16th of March was true.
> 
> On the 23rd of March, Pam Smith, Aubrey's aunt, did a search with a small group of people, but only found a sock with possible blood on it- police took it from them and send it to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. A search through her social media apps yielded no results.
> 
> Three months later, during Memorial Day weekend, a tip led the police to a shallow grave with a leather jacket near it- Aubrey was last seen wearing one - in Kenwood. The samples collected from there came back as not matching in a test against Aubrey's DNA, but Pam suspects that Aubrey's mother might've given them a different sample when the police asked her. The grave only had animal bones inside.
> 
> Aubrey's aunt, most likely the Pam Smith mentioned above, said that Aubrey's mother told her on the 6th of April, that her partner killed her, but there was no proof that would support this claim. When the police asked Aubrey's mother about it, she said that her partner "didn't say that".
> 
> On the 21st of November police has returned to the last place Aubrey was seen, a pond off of 280 Road in Grove. They brought four sniffer dogs who had "hits" on a tarp with what could be bloodstains inside a blue movable "pool" in a nearby shed that belonged to Aubrey's family and another four found "hits" around the pond itself. Three feet (91 cm) of water was drained before police skimmed the surface, but nothing seemed to be found. It took police a month to get the tarp 60 miles down the road to get it tested.
> 
> On the 9th of March, on the anniversary of Aubrey's vanishing, a candleligt vigil was held in her memory.
> 
> CONCLUSION
> 
> Aubrey's family suspects that she was a victim of a transphobic attack- given how they described the way Aubrey was treated both as a teenager and as an adult and the ammount of discrimination and straight up harassments and assaults she experienced I find that very possible. I'm not sure how many people were around at three AM in a reportedly rural area, the logistics throw a wrench into the whole thing for me. The motif is very possible, I'm just not sure about how would that happen.
> 
> There's also a chance that Aubrey was killed by her stepfather and possibly mother and brother. They are strangely absent in Aubrey's story, both before and after she went missing, and it's mostly her aunt and uncle who are actively looking for Aubrey. Her mother's comment about her boyfriend killing Aubrey and the tarp are pretty suspicious, and Pam would really have to suspect something if she cut Aubrey's mother out of her life (one article mentions that they're estranged). I'm not sure about the motive, maybe they didn't accept Aubrey's identity? Aubrey also wasn't caught on any cameras and it would seem like she vanished into thin air right next to her home.
> 
> Knowing that Aubrey was a drug addict, there's a chance that she overdosed by accident and her body was disposed of by someone she was with. She was reportedly recovering from a surgery, so her tolerance might've been lowered. It's strange that she didn't take her purse and presumably money, though. Maybe she really did owe money to someone suspicious?
> 
> As always, there's risk of suicide, due to all the hardships she experienced in life, but for what it's worth, her family say that "she'd never hurt herself" and she was full of life and love. She was always supporting others despite facing such vicious hate, and maybe that broke her? Especially since she was addicted, had an abusive boyfriend and had to come back to a place where she faced so much vitriol and might've been still facing it now? All I'm saying is that Aubrey had a lot to deal with emotionally and maybe she didn't share it due to her reputation of "always happy and supportive"? But that's just my wild speculation.
> 
> Her boyfriend was known to be abusive and it seemed like Aubrey was afraid of him, but as far as I know he was in Colorado- I couldn't find any info that he was in town. I don't think that he's involved.
>
> Aubrey's family, mostly her aunt and uncle, kept hanging up posters with Aubrey's photo and contact information. Pam Smith is currently estranged from Aubrey's mother and stepfather. Cherokee Nation has paid for bilboards along major highways in Tulsa seeking tips.
> 
> Aubrey is greatly missed by her aunt and uncle, who are the ones spearheading the whole investigation. Every time they remember Aubrey, they remember her resiliance and great love for everyone around, and how brave and strong she was in face of discrimination and other problems she faced. Inspired by her Cherokee pride, her uncle Christian Fencer started to learn more about their shared heritage, and he said that he was warmly welcomed and he started to learn stickball, a traditional Native American game similar to lacrosse.
> 
> In July 2020, the Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding Indian reservations that meant the case would now be investigated by tribal police and the FBI. The case is now handled by Shannon Buhl, the Director of the Cherokee Nation Marshal Service. Pam and Christian are hopeful that more resources and a Native American-led police will lead to finding Aubrey.
> 
> In January of 2021, Aubrey's family has propposed a bill called "Aubrey Alert", which would require the police to investigate the cases of "critically missing" adults immediately. It would pertain to people who were 18-59 who went missing under suspicious circumstances or were seen kidnapped or something similar. It also had special guidelines for Indigenous people. The bill was renamed to "Kasey Alert", after Kasey Russel, an Indigenous man who was at the time missing since 2016 and has been found deceased around July of 2022. It was renamed because some lawmakers straight up said that they will not support a bill named after a transgender person. Aubrey's family chose Kasey to honor his memory.
> 
> When she went missing, Aubrey was 25, so she would be about 29-30. She was 5' 9" - 5' 10" (69 - 70 Inches / 175 - 178 cm) and 140 - 170 lbs (64 - 77 kg). She was Indigenous American (Cherokee) and enrolled with Cherokee Nation. She had long brown hair and brown eyes. She had a tattoo of a triquetra (3 interconnected ovals) on her neck and "Shorty" on upper left arm. She was last seen wearing a black shirt, black thigh-high miniskirt, black hose and black leather boots with heels. If you have any info regarding Aubrey's disappearance, you can call FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or the Cherokee Nation Marshal Service at 918-207-3800.



> "We have been dismissed, ridiculed, & mocked while searching for our niece. We have been denied assistance in these searches but they’re counting each of these searches as ones they’ve coordinated. We have given law enforcement as much information as we have been given & we are the only ones working her case. Aubrey’s previous arrest records have been brought up by local “media”, only shedding a negative light on someone who isn’t here to defend herself; but our family will defend her."
> 
> We continue to search for our loved one, Aubrey Dameron. Aubrey was last seen leaving her home outside of Grove on March 9 around 3:30 a.m. She was last seen wearing a black mini skirt, black panty hose, black heels and a black jacket. She has two tattoos: a triquetra symbol on her back and the word "Shorty" on her upper left arm.
> 
> Anyone who has seen or heard from Aubrey since March 9 is asked to contact the Delaware County Sheriff’s Office at (918)253-4531 Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation at (800)522-8017 or tips@osbi.ok.gov. Or
