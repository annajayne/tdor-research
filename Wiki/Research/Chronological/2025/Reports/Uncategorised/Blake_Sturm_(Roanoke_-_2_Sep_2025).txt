> 
> Roanoke in Virginia is mourning the loss of Blake Sturm, a vibrant member of the LGBTQ+ community, whose body was discovered outside his home earlier this week. Blake, 25, had been reported missing on 30 August and was found deceased on Tuesday, 2 September. Police have stated that the death does not appear suspicious, though an investigation remains ongoing.
> 
> Blake was known for entertaining crowds with his drag performances and creating a space of acceptance. His obituary paints a portrait of a person who embraced life with colour and courage. He was a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, a certified welder, and someone who found beauty in the overlooked and broken.
> 
> Blake’s family and friends gathered on Friday evening for a memorial service filled with music, stories, and heartfelt tributes. A second service was held at Briery Branch Church of the Brethren in Dayton, Virginia, where mourners lit candles and shared memories of Blake’s kindness, humour, and resilience.
> 
> In lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations to the Trevor Project and the local Humane Society - causes close to Blake’s heart.
> 
> “Blake’s spark disappeared too soon,” his family wrote. “But the light he brought into the world will never be extinguished.”
> 
> Friends remembered him for his uplifting and bubbly personality.
> 
> “Someone you could always call, and he’s always there, and he’s always happy,” said one friend.
> 
> “There’s not a lot of drag kings in the area; he was fully trying to go full steam ahead in creating the organisation for drag kings here locally. So, I know that presence is going to be greatly missed,” added another.
