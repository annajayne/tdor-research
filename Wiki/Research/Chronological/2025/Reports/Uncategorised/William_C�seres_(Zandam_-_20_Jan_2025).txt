> Dutch authorities are investigating the death of 35-year-old Venezuelan William Cáseres, also known as "drag queen" Alyssa, as a "crime." Cáseres fled to the Netherlands two years ago and was legally granted asylum last November due to the risk of persecution in Venezuela.
> 
> Cáseres obtained a residence permit in the Netherlands in November after his asylum application was approved. While awaiting suitable housing, he rented a room in the Dutch city of Zaandam a week before his death. It was in that apartment that authorities found his body on January 20.
> 
> "This is a 35-year-old man originally from Venezuela, who had been living in the Netherlands for some time, but had recently moved to the apartment in Hogendijk. The victim spoke Spanish and English and is also known to have regularly performed as a drag queen," Dutch police said.
> 
> He also stressed that he "assumes the victim died due to a violent act" and asks for cooperation from those who knew Cáseres or may have information about what happened.
> 
> Police have not yet confirmed whether Cáseres's "drag queen" identity played a role in the crime, nor have they revealed whether they have any theories about the motive for the murder.
> 
> The LGBTI community in the Netherlands is "in mourning," Sandro Kortekaas, president of the LGBT Asylum Support Foundation in the Netherlands, told RTL television today.
