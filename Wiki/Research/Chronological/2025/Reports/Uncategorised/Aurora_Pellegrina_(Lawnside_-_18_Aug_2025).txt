> I'm writing to report the death of a member of the trans community. My ex-girlfriend, who had lived with me for 7 years, left me this February. On August 18, 2025, police came to my house to tell me they had found her body in an abandoned house in the woods in Lawnside, New Jersey (USA). They came to me because the only identification on her still had my address. They were unable to determine the date or cause of death.  Her name was Aurora Pellegrina, but she also went by Alexa and Luna (she was a system and had DID). She was 36 years old. Aurora used she/her pronouns, Alexa used xe/xem or they/they pronouns, and Luna used fay/faer or they/them pronouns. I've attached the best photo I could find.

> I may have let her walk away when she decided that she wanted to leave, but I still love her with my whole heart and she mattered a lot to me. She will be part of the TDoR memorial service at my church in Cherry Hill.
