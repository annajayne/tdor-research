> This is such sad news. I don’t have details so please don’t ask. So here’s a fun fact about me that you probably don’t know - I lived in Philadelphia for almost a decade and I was a part of the ballroom scene there. This was back in the day when we would go to the Breakfast Club every week for a ball! It was hot and ghetto! But it was sooooo fun! And Mother Breakfast would be selling that DELICIOUS ass food!
> 
> Anyway, Sonny was always in the building. I remember he first started walking Butch Realness then eventually trans man realness. He always spoke when he saw me. We weren’t friends or anything like that - but like, we knew each other and there was a mutual respect.
> 
> It’s crazy because he JUST posted on his page 1 day ago on Facebook. Man… life is so unpredictable. The community took a loss with this one. RIP Sonny 


 
> Sending Love to the Philly Trans Community
> 
> We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Sonny Hopkins, a beloved Black trans man from Philadelphia. His light touched many, and his absence is felt profoundly.
> 
> In this time of sorrow, we stand in solidarity with the Philly trans community, honoring Sonny’s life and the impact he made. May his memory inspire us to continue advocating for love, acceptance, and justice for all trans individuals.
