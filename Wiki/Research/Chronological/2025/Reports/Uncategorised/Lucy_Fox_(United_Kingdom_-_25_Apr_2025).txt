//Researcher's Note: Lucy was the subject of an attack in Hartlepool, and an anecdotal second hand report from a friend suggests her death was suicide. However, as her death is the subject of an investigation and her partner has been advised not to comment on the circumstances the case is being filed as "Uncategorised" for now.//



> Lucy-Anne Fox passed away, aged 46, on April the 25th 2025. Lucy was a fantastic cook and had been a celebrated Italian chef. She loved video games, fantasy books, the moon, the ocean, and her cats. Her favourite flowers were orchids, and her favourite ice cream flavour was cookie dough. She could do an excellent Mickie Mouse impression. She was always giving, fiercely protective of her friends and community, and endlessly funny. She is missed by her wife, Kathryn Fox, her family, her community, and her friends.



> This was my wife, Lucy Fox. Happy to share some more details about her and her life via DM.

> Just received this from my sister in the UK, her friend died by suicide following the UK Court’s ruling on the definition of a woman…
> 
> “She's a trans woman and the latest legislation was the last straw for her. Then abused in the street just for existing was brutal. She just couldn't take any more”



> My irrepressible, irreplaceable wife Lucy died this week. I have some social media posts scheduled to post over the next week and then I’m not sure when I’m going to be around again. Hold your loved ones tight for me, and shout extra loud for equality for her.



> Earlier this month, my two best friends were attacked, each in separate incidences.
> 
> First, Katy was held at knifepoint on the streets in broad daylight in an attempted robbery. They managed to come away physically unharmed, though obviously shaken. The man was eventually arrested and was charged with attempted robbery and unlawful possession of a bladed article (a Stanley knife), plus two other attempted robberies, causing criminal damage to windows, and stealing a pedal cycle. Any news articles about the incident also misgendered Katy.
> 
> The next day, my friend Lucy, Katy’s wife, was subjected to a violent, degrading, and transphobic attack right outside her own home. She was chased by a group of men, physically assaulted, undressed against her will, and subjected to transphobic slurs while they laughed. The attack left her with serious injuries, including to her head, back, and knees, and chunks of her hair were ripped out.
> 
> Police were called, though the three culprits had already fled. Upon arrival, Lucy approached the responding officer, expecting to start telling him what happened. But instead of being rescued from the hate crimes committed against her, Lucy had an extremely distressing interaction with a responding police officer, which resulted in further physical pain, public humiliation, and emotional distress. After this interaction with the officer, the officer then interacted with Katy in a way that they experienced as hostile, dishonest, and ableist. Lucy and Katy believe that the officer was so hostile because she is a disabled and vulnerable trans woman.
> 
> I sat on video call with them that night, Lucy sitting broken and in pain. Her memory barely lasted a minute at a time. It was terrifying seeing her in this state, seeing what had been done to her and what saying effects this will have on both her and Katy. Any sound from the street or car that pulled up had her in a panic, thinking the men may have returned. Katy and I pleaded with her to go to the hospital, but Lucy felt she couldn’t trust another emergency service, not after she felt she had fallen victim to the last one.
> 
> The next morning, Lucy collapsed. An ambulance was called and Lucy was taken to hospital. At A&E, it was discovered that Lucy had multiple head injuries, evidence of a dislocated shoulder and torn muscles in her shoulder and bicep, bruises on her back, and torn and bloody knees. As I sit here writing this, her knees still carry the scabs and scars of the attack.
> 
> The following weeks felt like a living nightmare for Katy and Lucy. They are terrified to leave the house, anxious anytime someone came to the door, and still recovering mentally, physically, and emotionally. Lucy especially is experiencing lasting issues with memory and ongoing pain from her experiences.
> 
> This GoFundMe has been setup to help provide support to Katy and Lucy while they navigate their way through this. Some of the things we are hoping to provide them with are:
> 
> Time off work for Katy £650 (one week)
> Therapy fees £800
> Physio for Lucy’s shoulder £300
> Taxi fair (to avoid walking people on the street) £150
> Security cameras for the property £100
> Legal fees £1500
> Moving expenses (they are looking to either relocate to a safer town or immigrate to Canada) £2,000 - £5,000
> 
> This fundraiser is intended solely to support Lucy and Katy during their recovery from the recent traumatic events and the challenges that have followed. All descriptions of events reflect personal experiences and are shared to help illustrate the emotional, physical, and financial impact on those involved. We do not intend to interfere with or prejudge the outcome of any investigation or legal proceeding.



> UPDATE: April 27, 2025
> 
> There is no proper way to make this update, so I will just have to say it.
> 
> Lucy passed away the morning of April 25, 2025. She will continue to be loved and cherished by her wife and friends.
> 
> Thank you to everyone who has donated so far, the funds have been an immediate help to pay the new expenses.
> 
> The fund will continue to operate to assist Katy with related expenses and time off work to grieve. As this is the first place announcing Lucy’s passing, if you know Katy personally, please be considerate of their space right now.
> 
> We love you so much, Lucy. You will be forever missed.
