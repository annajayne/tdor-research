[Editor´s Note: there is contradictory informmation on this case; most accounts describe her death as ¨due to an attack¨, but the most recent states thhat she was HIV positive and died from TB]


> On September 19, Caribe Afirmativo, an NGO that promotes respect for and recognition of the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the Colombian Caribbean, denounced the "violent death" of a trans woman, identified as Shantal.
> 
> In a statement, the organization said the trans woman, who was the popular queen of the Rebolo Gay Carnival and also a cultural leader, was the victim of a violent attack, for which she remained in intensive care for several days .
> 
> However, EL HERALDO learned of Shantal's death certificate, which certifies that her death was due to natural causes.
> 
> A woman died after an accident when she arrived home: her dog came out to greet her, pushed her and she fell over a railing.
> 
> According to the general, authorities learned of this case after reading the statement issued by Caribe Afirmativo, so they began investigating.
> 
> "The information we have is that the homeless woman, who was also a trans woman, was admitted to the health center for respiratory problems. There, they detected that she had tuberculosis, and that was the cause of death. She also apparently had a second HIV diagnosis," explained the MEBAR commander, noting that this information was shared by the doctor with the human rights official.
> 
> He noted that the institution was not aware of the case earlier because it was not a violent death, but a natural one: "She did have some bruises on her arms, according to what they told me, but according to what the doctor said, they were bruises from some time ago, not recent. The cause of death was tuberculosis, a respiratory infection, which is why the body was not taken to the Forensic Medicine Department because the death certificate was listed as natural," he explained.



> Caribe Afirmativo, an NGO that ensures respect and recognition of the rights of LGBTIQ+ people in the Colombian Caribbean, confirmed in recent hours the death of Shantal, a renowned trans woman who in life stood out as the popular queen of the Rebolo Gay Carnival and was also a cultural leader.
> 
> In a statement, the agency indicated that the victim remained in intensive care for several days after being attacked with blunt objects between Thursday and Friday of last week. The serious injuries he sustained compromised his well-being and ultimately led to his death last weekend.
> 
> The crime has generated consternation in the city's LGBTIQ+ community, not only due to the violence perpetrated against Shantal, but also due to the lack of visibility surrounding the case. Social leaders warn that in areas such as 38th Street and Murillo and around the INEM (National Institute of Women) in Soledad, trans women have been reporting threats and extortion, which have exacerbated the climate of fear and insecurity.
> 
> According to the Caribe Afirmativo Human Rights Observatory, this murder is the 54th documented case so far this year in the country, and the third recorded in Atlántico. The organization warns that these incidents are underreported, obscuring the true extent of violence against people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.
> 
> Caribe Afirmativo called on the Atlántico Sectional Prosecutor's Office to promptly conduct an investigation, under the parameters established in Directive 006 of 2023, which mandates the application of differential approaches in the investigation of violence motivated by bias. According to preliminary information, Shantal was beaten with blunt objects, a finding that reinforces the hypothesis of a crime of intolerance.
> 
> The organization also urged the Governor's Office of Atlántico, the Mayor's Office of Barranquilla, and the Mayor's Office of Soledad to implement urgent measures to protect trans women, strengthen policies to prevent bias-based violence, and guarantee safe environments.

> In events being investigated by authorities, a trans woman known as Chantal died from injuries she received during a beating she allegedly received last week, according to Wilson Castañeda of the Caribe Afirmativo Corporation.
> 
> 
> 
> The trans woman, who was the popular queen of the gay carnival in the Rebolo neighborhood of Barranquilla , was allegedly beaten, but the location of the incident and who was responsible for the attacks are still unknown.
> 
> Wilson Castañeda told Barranquilla's Emisora ??Atlántico that "Chantal was a trans woman who held a high level of leadership , especially in cultural initiatives in Barranquilla, in the southwest, and that distinguished her as a trans leader. What we want to point out is that her leadership gave her greater visibility, and that's why it's important to identify the relationship between this visibility and the events that led to this violent death ."
> 
> She insisted that trans people continue to be the most affected by this phenomenon of violence. "And we demand that they be investigated to determine the relationship between these violent deaths and their trans identity or expression."
> 
> He recalled that, according to the monitoring carried out by the human rights observatory of the Caribe Afirmativo Corporation , 54 LGBTIQ+ people have been murdered so far in 2025 , which is why Castañeda asked the authorities to carry out the corresponding investigations.
> 
> According to the monitoring carried out by the Caribe Afirmativo Corporation, this is the second LGBTIQ person to die this week in the Atlantic. On Tuesday, September 16, another member of this community died inside a bar in downtown Barranquilla, in events that are still under investigation.
> 
> The victim was identified as Luis Carlos Salas Toledo , who had requested a cubicle at the location and was found convulsing shortly afterward. He later died in a city health center.
