> The Vivienne died in January, aged 32. (Getty)
> 
> The inquest into the death of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK star The Vivienne heard that the star had a “relatively high” level of ketamine in their system at the time of death.
> 
> The star, whose real name was James Lee Williams, died in January at the age of 32.
> 
> The inquest was opened and adjourned in February after a coroner’s officer was told the star was found dead in the bathroom of their home. “Post-mortem testing has been undertaken, identifying an unnatural cause of death,” she said at the time.
> 
> Now, the Liverpool Echo has reported that forensic toxicologist Dr Kerry Taylor told Cheshire Coroner’s Court on Monday morning (30 June) that James had a “relatively high” level of ketamine in their body at the time of death, suggesting “moderate to excessive use at some point prior to death”.
> 
> Ketamine, versions of which have been prescribed for depression, can lead to drowsiness, seizures and cardiac effects, Taylor added.
> 
> Pathologist Dr David Butterworth, who carried out the post-mortem said: “In my opinion, the cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest due to ketamine use,” the newspaper went on to report.
> 
> James’ sister Chanel told the court: “We acknowledge that James’ death is as a result of drug use but we wholeheartedly know that was not their intention. They loved life, they loved their family and friends and they loved their career.”
> 
> The star’s father, Lee, told the proceedings that his son had a “quiet and private life,” adding: “He never turned his back on anyone. He wanted to help his community, to help other drag queens achieve their goals.”
> 
> A friend and neighbour said The Vivienne was “amazing,” adding that the pair has become “really good friends” before she knew of the star’s fame.
> 
> Best friend Bobby Muske is reported to have said: “James was the kindest person I knew. He would help everyone, he would help charities, do gigs for nothing. He supported Sahir House a lot, an Aids charity in Liverpool.
> 
> “He was fiery sometimes. If he wanted to do something, he was going to do it. That was the way he was.”
> 
> Senior coroner Jacqueline Devonish said the medical cause of death would be recorded as cardio-respiratory arrest due to ketamine use.
> 
> Delivering her verdict, Devonish added: “On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that James Lee Williams’ death was a misadventure. He took ketamine but he did not intend to end his own life.”
> 
> Police had been called to the performer’s home in Chorlton-by-Backford, Cheshire, on 5 January, but it was likely that James died on Friday evening and was not found and pronounced dead until the Sunday. The toxicology results showed that there was still a fairly high amount of ketamine in James’ system when they were found, suggesting an “acute overdose”, she added.
> 
> When news of The Vivienne’s death broke, her publicist Simon Jones described the drag performer as “incredibly loved.”
> 
> The star’s death was met with a wave of grief and shock and the family said they had been overwhelmed by the love and support at a vigil later that month.
> 
> RuPaul took a moment to honour the queen during DragCon UK in January, saying: “We want to focus on love, and we are going to remember our dear The Vivienne with love, life, happiness, because that’s what she was all about.”
