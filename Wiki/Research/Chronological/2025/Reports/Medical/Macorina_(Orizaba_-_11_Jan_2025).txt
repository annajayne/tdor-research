cardiorespiratory arrest



> Orizaba, Ver.- In the face of what they consider an "outrage", citizens in general have called through social networks to demonstrate at the Semefo (Forensic Medical Service) facilities, after authorities of this place demanded the amount of 15 thousand pesos to deliver the body of a person because he had no direct relatives.
> 
> According to neighbors of “Macorina,” a trans woman who recently died in public due to a cardiorespiratory arrest, since she did not have family, they organized to raise money for this person's family expenses. However, since they were not direct relatives, they were demanded to pay 15 thousand pesos, an amount they consider excessive and illogical.
> 
> “What do they gain by sending her to the mass grave? It is clear that they are only interested in money. Where is the human side of the authorities?” the protesters questioned, emphasizing that the request is not only unfair, but also reflects a lack of empathy on the part of the institutions in charge.
> 
> Feeling violated, “Macorina's acquaintances have raised the possibility of holding a protest march to the Semefo to demand that the right to dignified treatment for the deceased be respected, because despite the economic obstacles, they will continue to look for a way to give her a Christian burial.
> 
> “Macorina,” who was a well-known figure in the area for her friendliness and her life linked to the transgender community, died early last Saturday morning on Calle Oriente 9 in Orizaba. Although it was initially speculated that her death could have been caused by hypothermia, it was later revealed that the death was caused by sudden cardiorespiratory arrest.
> 
> The story of “Macorina” once again highlights the difficulties faced by trans people in society, not only because of their gender identity, but also because of the lack of sensitivity in health and funeral systems, which should offer more equitable and dignified care for all citizens.
