> 
> The application of industrial silicone in a homemade procedure on the buttocks killed a trans woman, in Capão da Canoa , on the North Coast. The case occurred last Sunday (23). The procedure was performed by another trans woman who launched the scene after realizing that the victim was feeling unwell.
> 
> The victim was picked up by the suspect in Porto Alegre and taken to Capão da Canoa to undergo the procedure. A friend of the victim accompanied the entire process. Both knew that other people had already died after applications made by the suspect, but decided to go ahead.
> 
> On Saturday (22), the three women went to a terreiro in Santo Antônio da Patrulha, where they participated in a spiritual ritual. According to the friend's account, a priest said that everything would go well.
> 
> According to the police, the procedure began in the victim's apartment. According to the friend's report, at a certain point the suspect realized that the victim was not well and asked her to get some water. She then asked for milk with salt, believing that the victim's condition was getting worse.
> 
> However, the situation worsened and, before help arrived, the suspect had gathered her belongings and left. Her friend asked neighbors for help and called SAMU, but the victim was already dead when rescuers arrived.
> 
> The suspect is being investigated for two other deaths. The police are investigating the case as intentional homicide (when there is intent or acceptance of the risk of killing) and illegal practice of medicine.
> 
> The General Institute of Expertise (IGP) was on site to carry out the examination, and the body was sent to the Legal Medical Department (DML) for an autopsy.
