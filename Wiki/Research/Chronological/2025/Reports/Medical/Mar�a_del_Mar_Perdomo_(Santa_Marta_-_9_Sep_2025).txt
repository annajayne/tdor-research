possible scopolimine poisoning

**Researcherś Note:** If this does turn out to be Scopolimine poisoning, this could turn into a homicide case - see this extract from 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopolamine:

> **Ingestion of scopolamine can render a victim unconscious for 24 hours or more. In large doses, it can cause respiratory failure and death. The highest prevalence of misuse seems to be recorded in Colombia.** Unofficial estimates there put the number of annual scopolamine incidents at approximately 50,000. A travel advisory published by the U.S. Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in 2012 stated:
> 
> **One common and particularly dangerous method that criminals use to rob a victim is through the use of drugs.** Scopolamine is most often administered in liquid or powder form in foods and beverages. The majority of these incidents occur in nightclubs and bars, and usually, men, perceived to be wealthy, are targeted by young, attractive women. It is recommended that to avoid becoming a victim of scopolamine, a person should never accept food or beverages offered by strangers or new acquaintances, nor leave food or beverages unattended in their presence. Victims of scopolamine or other drugs should seek immediate medical attention.[64]
> 
> Between 1998 and 2004, 13% of emergency-room admissions for "poisoning with criminal intentions" in a clinic of Bogotá have been attributed to scopolamine, and 44% to benzodiazepines.[17] Most commonly, the person has been poisoned by a robber who gave the victim a scopolamine-laced beverage, in the hope that the victim would become unconscious or unable to effectively resist the robbery.[17]

> The Volver a Vivir Foundation, the organizer of the contest, reported that the young woman arrived in the capital of Magdalena to participate in the event and, after feeling unwell, was admitted to the Clínica del Prado, where she sadly died the following day. According to the initial medical report, Perdomo could have been a victim of scopolamine; however, the organization emphasized that there is currently no official report from the Forensic Medicine Department confirming this hypothesis.
> 
> In a statement, the foundation denied initial reports circulating on social media and some online outlets that the young woman had been found dead in a hotel. The organization explained that, after going out to dinner, María del Mar told her entourage that she was feeling ill and decided to take herself to the health center, where she later died.
> 
> The mayor of Santa Marta, Carlos Pinedo Cuello, expressed his regret for the incident and announced that a health commission had been appointed to investigate the true cause of death. “We ask the authorities to move forward expeditiously in clarifying this case, the causes of which are still under investigation. I have called a meeting with the relevant authorities to learn firsthand the details of what happened. Until the Forensic Medicine report is issued, we reiterate that any information circulating cannot be considered official ,” the president stated on his X account.



> Along with the poisoning hypothesis, the Santa Marta Metropolitan Police have not ruled out the possibility of robbery. An investigator from the agency explained that they are reviewing security cameras at the hotel and surrounding areas, in addition to reconstructing the victim's final hours to determine whether third-party involvement was involved. The investigation remains open, and authorities have urged caution in light of the circulation of unconfirmed reports.
