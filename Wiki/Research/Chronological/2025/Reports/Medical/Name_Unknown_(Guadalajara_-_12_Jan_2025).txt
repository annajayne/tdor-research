> A trans woman died after undergoing a cosmetic procedure with a person who allegedly lacked knowledge of the subject, prompting the Prosecutor's Office to open an investigation into the crime of intentional homicide.
> 
> The law enforcement agency announced that on January 12, the victim, a trans woman, had voluntarily arrived at a private home to be injected with these substances.
> 
> The individual allegedly injected a chemical substance called polymer or biopolymer into the victim's buttocks, which could have caused health complications that could have led to death.
> 
> On April 15, an arrest warrant was issued for the person who allegedly had no professional knowledge of the subject and was injecting others with the polymers.
> 
> The person who allegedly performed the procedure took the victim to the Municipal Medical Services, where she died after showing symptoms of cardiorespiratory arrest.

> The State Attorney General's Office has investigated other cases of similar procedures, as well as medical negligence, and therefore urges anyone attempting to undergo an aesthetic or cosmetic procedure to review the certification and reliability of the establishments, which must be supported and supervised by qualified personnel. It also invites them to verify that the person performing the procedure is an accredited individual with a professional license and valid permits from the health sector.
