> Cristina was a 40-year-old Argentinian trans woman who had lived in France for over 15 years. On August 8, she died suddenly at her home in Melun (Île-de-France), following medical complications. Her passing was sudden and painless.
> 
> Cristina lived in extreme poverty, socially isolated, and survived thanks to sex work. Despite the difficulties, she bravely navigated her life, but today she leaves us without resources or loved ones to organize her funeral.
> 
> Her father, who lives in Argentina, cannot afford to travel to France or pay for his daughter's funeral. He asked for our help to organize a dignified cremation ceremony and receive Cristina's ashes at a later date.
> 
> Acceptess-T is launching a fundraising campaign to raise €3,000 to cover all costs related to the funeral and the repatriation of ashes. Every donation, large or small, will help give Cristina the farewell she deserves and support her father during this difficult time.



> Sudden death for medical reasons : Cristina, a trans woman sex worker in France, migrant from Argentina, died at 41 in Melun in great poverty. A local trans org is raising money to send back her ashes to her father in Argentina.
