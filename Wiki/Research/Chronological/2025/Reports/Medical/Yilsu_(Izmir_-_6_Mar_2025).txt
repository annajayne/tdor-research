> We lost Yilsu!
> 
> Yilsu was one of our trans women friends who tried to survive on Bornova Street and its surroundings. According to the information we received from Yilsu's friends, her life ended due to complications from a surgical operation. However, we know that every trans person's death is political. We will not only mourn Yilsu, we will continue to commemorate her and all trans people who lost their lives. We will continue to fight for the vision of a world where we are not alone, we are not afraid, and we are equal and free.
> 
> We offer our condolences to Yilsu's family, friends and the entire trans community. We are angry, we are sad, we share our pain.
