> As I was preparing for Transgender Day of Remembrance and wanted to light a candle for every transgender person who died this year, I noticed that Julia Steenken, a transgender person from Oldenburg, Germany, also died on April 3, 2025 officially from a heart defect. She was born on October 24, 1974, and was therefore 50 years young. She was an activist and also did a lot politically against discrimination against trans people. Especially in the current political situation, we miss her very much. would you add her in your list?



> An obituary by Ria Cybill Geyer.
> Julia Steenken passed away on the morning of April 3, 2025. Sudden and unexpected are probably not the adjectives that would be appropriate in this context. She had suffered from heart disease for years.
> 
> Julia was a trans woman. Her personal focus was on "woman" in the best sense of the word. Julia was never flashy, flamboyant, or hyper-feminine. She was a modest, sometimes even unassuming, figure. She wasn't someone who rode everywhere on a unicorn or constantly waved the rainbow flag or its modern versions. Julia was active—mostly behind the scenes—but always professional. Although she wasn't a trained lawyer, her expertise was comparable to that of lawyers and judges. She also served as a lay judge at the Social Court in Oldenburg and, until her retirement, at the Labor Court. Many of her expert opinions, commissioned by non-profit organizations, were incorporated into legislation. She leaves a particularly large void for the dgti e.V. (German Association for Transgender and Intersex People) .
> 
> Who was Julia in private?
> Julia was a trained bank clerk and had a knack for finance. She was selfless and helped wherever she could and wherever it mattered to her. Even though she described herself as "dyed-in-the-wool black," she lived solidarity without regard for the political context.
> 
> This may also explain her sympathy for Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek universe: Julia was a true "Trekkie" and participated intensively in online role-playing in this world until the hours before her death.
> 
> Her true passion, however, lay with the railway, and in particular the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg Railway (GOE). Julia's family was railway worker family. She, however, had not entered the railway service—due to her father's warnings—and had instead learned "something sensible." Until her death, she struggled with the fact that she was not allowed to serve our country in uniform. Nevertheless, she was a railway historian who had acquired profound and well-researched knowledge of the history of railways in Germany and all related state organizations.
> 
> With her extensive knowledge, she was undoubtedly one of the leading figures in the field. There was no question on any subject she didn't know or couldn't quickly grasp and master. Even when I—a trained police officer—had questions about specific situations and discussed them with Julia, she instantly recalled the relevant legal paragraphs. Her FREMO project, "Oldenstadt," will likely fade into obscurity. Julia had many more plans and ideas she wanted to implement in the coming years, which will now remain unfulfilled.
> 
> Julia was opinionated, unyielding, uncomfortably professional, annoying when she called at 00:30 in the morning, a humanist and above all: My friend!
> 
> Farewell Jule! They probably need a railway historian elsewhere! You're missed here! You leave a huge void that you would have liked to have in our community, a void that would have made you more noticeable
