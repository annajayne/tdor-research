road accident


> Sophia Hutchins, the 29-year-old manager and close friend of Caitlyn Jenner, has been killed in a road collision that sent her plummeting down a cliff.
> 
> Hutchins, who has managed Jenner’s business affairs since 2017, was driving an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) when she reportedly ran into another car’s bumper with such impact that it sent the vehicle “plunging 350 feet down into a ravine”.
> 
> The accident, which was first reported by TMZ, occurred near her home in Malibu and Hutchins was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.
> 
> There were two people in the car hit by Hutchins’ ATV, but they were not injured in the crash.
> 
> The Independent has contacted Jenner, authorities and the Kardashians for comment.
> 
> Hutchins, who was the CEO of a now-defunct beauty brand, formed a close bond with Jenner after meeting in 2015 when she came out as a transgender woman. They were introduced by their hairdresser.
> 
> She regularly appeared in the documentary tracking Jenner’s life post-transition, I Am Cait, as well as Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
> 
> In 2017, Hutchins, who was also transgender, replaced Jenner’s ex-wife Kris Jenner as Caitlin’s manager following their divorce, moving into her Malibu home worth $3.5m.
> 
> She also became CEO and director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation, a non-profit organisation that “promotes equality and combats discrimination” against transgender people.
> 
> After posting regular photos from the mansion, it was incorrectly reported that the pair were romantically linked – but Hutchins told The New York Times in 2018 that this was never the case.
> 
> She spoke about their friendship in more detail on The Hidden Truth podcast, stating: “I wouldn’t describe it as romantic. I would describe it as: we’re partners, business partners.”
> 
> “We have so much in common and see the world so similarly, and are both such a good match for each other because we challenge each other. We’re partners in everything we do – we’re inseparable, we’re business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together.”
> 
> She said that she offered to manage Jenner as she noticed “all these people taking massive advantage” of the reality star, who appeared on ITV series I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Haere! in 2019.
> 
> “I was saying: ‘Caitlyn, if I don’t step in here and start managing you, you’re going to go broke,’” she told The New York Times in 2019.
> 
> Hutchins also revealed that she was supported by Jenner’s ex Kris, with whom Caitlin has two daughters, Kylie and Kendall Jenner.
> 
> “It’s not like we’re like girlfriends having drinks all the time, but you know, if there’s ever a concern or ever a question or anything I have needed help with, Kris would be the first phone call,” Hutchins told Behind the Velvet Rope podcast in 2020.

>

> Jenner and Hutchins, who was also transgender, first met in 2015 shortly after the now-75-year-old announced her own transition.
> 
> Hutchins appeared in several episodes of Jenner’s hit “E!” docuseries “I Am Cait,” which chronicled Jenner’s life after her transition.
>

> 
> During her junior year, Hutchins resigned from her position as president of the Class of 2018 to complete her gender transition.
> 
> Hutchins credited Jenner as motivation for her transition in 2016, saying the Olympic gold medalist’s coming-out interview made her realize it was “OK” to transition.
> 
> “(Jenner) made it so much more real for (Hutchins,) like normal and successful people do this and people are OK when they do it,” Hutchins said in a research article from the university.
> 
> Hutchins decided to move forward with a full transition after the interview.
> 
> After graduating from Pepperdine in 2017, Hutchins founded the sunscreen company Lumasol and became Jenner’s manager.
> 
> The pair met through a mutual hairstylist and makeup artist and immediately “kicked it off.”
> 
> “We got really close as friends,” Hutchins told Juicy Scoop in 2020. “We met through our hairstylist and makeup artist, ironically enough. He was doing my hair one day and he said, ‘I’m going to a photoshoot right after this and Caitlyn is going to be there and Caitlyn would like to meet you.’ 
> 
> “Went over to the photoshoot, we kicked it off, became good friends and I learned a lot about what was going on in Caitlyn’s life and I just felt it was a financial s—tshow — so much money was being thrown everywhere — and nobody was really running the show. 
> 
> “She didn’t have a manager. Kris wasn’t doing it anymore since they divorced and I felt could do a really good job.”
> 
> She served as a surrogate for former President Donald Trump’s campaign during the 2024 presidential election, where she made several television appearances in support of the ex-commander-in-chief.
> 
> She posed with Trump during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in February 2024.

> “The energy, passion and commitment for our movement to Save America has never been greater! We will never give up!” Hutchins captioned the post.
> 
> Jenner and Hutchins were back at Mar-a-Lago for the election night watch party on Nov. 5, 2024.
> 
> “It’s been a wild ride. From the convention & inauguration in 2016, to 2020, to the most insane campaign in US history in 2024, I love this family as if they were my own. I will keep fighting for America in any way I am told- we’ve made it this far and I don’t plan on stopping, only speeding up,” Hutchins wrote. “There is no team of people, led by the man himself, The 47th POTUS @realdonaldtrump I would want to do it with! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
> 
> In January, Hutchins shared one of her final public appearances alongside Jenner, where the pair attended the Starlight Ball as part of Trump’s inauguration festivities in Washington, DC.
