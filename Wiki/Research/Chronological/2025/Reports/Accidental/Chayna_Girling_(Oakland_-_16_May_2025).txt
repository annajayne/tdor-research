fell

> Chayna Girling passed away on May 16, 2025, apparently due to a fall while packing her wardrobe for a festival. She was assaulted a few years ago, quite seriously and it seems like she got a fairly serious head injury from it. Idk if that had anything to do with their death, which is why I am sharing it.


> In Loving Memory of a Burner, Photographer, and Classy Soul…Chayna Girling
> We remember and celebrate a radiant spirit—someone who danced in the dust, captured the world through a fearless lens, and moved through life with fire and authenticity.
> 
> As a burner, she embraced radical self-expression, community, and creativity—lighting up the playa with both fire and heart. Behind the camera, she had a gift for seeing the soul in every frame, telling stories with compassion and artistry. And in every interaction, she carried herself with an elegance that always left an impression.
> 
> Rest in light, dear friend. You’ll always be part of the flame.



> People are complicated and messy, but they are still fucking worthy.

> Chayna Girling,
> 
> You and I met in high points of our life and truly became friends at the lowest points in our lives.  
> 
> You helped me survive, I think I did the same for you. We tore off our masks and allowed each other to be imperfect beings, celebrating the best in each other, advising each other where we needed to grow.  We found joy and sorrow, we allowed both to happen.  I appreciate you never tried to cheer me up but always felt you cheered me on.  
> 
> Again, I hope you felt I did the same for you.
> 
> Thank you for all the nights of being messy.  Taking turns crying when I don’t think we allowed others to see that vulnerability.  Thank you for growing with me, even if others never saw that labor. Thank you for sharing hot bitch music with me.  Thank you for emotional support popcorn.  Thank you for working on yourself and accountability. Thank you for letting me try on your old suits.  Thank you for being one of my people when I felt people abandoned me. And I hope you felt the same for me.
> 
> It’s hard right now, I haven’t had beautiful and poetic words, however I did wail in grief the moment I was told.  I. Have never death wailed before and it was a heartbreak I didn’t know was possible in me.  Thank you for revealing a truly vulnerable depth.
> 
> It’ll never be goodbye.  I hold too much inside me that you helped bring out.  When I return to darkness, I hope we touch each other in the ether as we did in the light of conciousness.
