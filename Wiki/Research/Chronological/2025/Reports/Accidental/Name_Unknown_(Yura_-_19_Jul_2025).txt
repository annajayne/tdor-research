> When you hear a train whistle, you usually stop, but this time, the story was different. A trans woman of approximately 25 years old met a tragic end in the Yura district after being run over by a PeruRail train transporting minerals. The accident occurred at kilometer 17 of the Arequipa - Puno railway , in the area known as UPIS Milagros.
> 
> Fatal accident on the Arequipa-Puno highway
> According to initial reports from the Peruvian National Police , the woman attempted to cross the railroad tracks just as the heavy locomotive was moving forward. The result was catastrophic, as her body was severely mutilated and found on the side of the tracks.
> 
> The unforgiving train
> The convoy, which belongs to PeruRail and was in the middle of transporting cargo, failed to stop in time. The driver activated emergency protocols, but it was too late. The victim, whose identity has not yet been officially confirmed, died instantly.
> 
> Neighbors in the area reported hearing no screams or alarm signals. Only the metallic rumble of the train, followed by an eerie silence. Some witnesses arrived at the scene minutes later, alerted by the railway company's security personnel.
> 
> To cross or not to cross?
> That's the question often asked by those who live near an active railway line. In UPIS Milagros, as in many other areas of the country, there are no automatic barriers, visible signs, or safe pedestrian crossings. Residents pointed out on social media that the lack of infrastructure is a daily occurrence and sometimes results in tragedies like this one.
> 
> A silent train and a dangerous track in Arequipa
> Despite their size, the trains can be surprisingly quiet, especially if the surroundings are calm. “We saw it go by a while ago, but no one imagined something like this would happen,” commented one resident.
