drowned


This Wednesday, August 16, the lifeless body of a woman was found on the banks of a ravine in Barbosa.

Unfortunately, this body appears to belong to a woman from the LGBTQ+ community who had been sought since Monday.

According to the information, 'Anyolina', as the victim was called, left her house located in the Porvenir neighborhood somewhat disoriented in the early hours of Monday, around 5:30 in the morning, and acquaintances mention that she said she was going to go swimming, but since she knew how to face these waters, no one thought she was going to drown.

In fact, they'd be searching for her in other areas of the city. However, she had drowned that Monday morning and was swept away by the creek's current to Barbosa.

The lifeless body of 'Anyolina' was found by a resident of the area, and firefighters arrived at the scene to rescue her.
