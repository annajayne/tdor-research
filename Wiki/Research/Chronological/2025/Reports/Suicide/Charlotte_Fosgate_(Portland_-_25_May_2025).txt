> "It is with heavy hearts and profound sadness that we share the passing of Charlotte Fosgate, a 17-year-old from Oak Grove, Oregon, who left this world on May 2, 2025. She jumped off the bridge to commit suicide.
> 
> "Charlotte was a vibrant and creative teenager navigating life as a transgender girl in a world that too often failed to show her the kindness she so deeply deserved. She was last seen on the evening of May 1 and reported missing soon after. Her final public messages, posted the next morning, offered a heartbreaking farewell from a high bridge—an image that now haunts everyone who knew and cared for her.
> 
> "Charlotte’s tweets, which quietly said goodbye—'it’s a pretty view' and 'long way down'—were viewed millions of times in the hours after her death. But what should have been a space for grief and remembrance became a mirror of society’s cruelty. The response from parts of the internet was callous, transphobic, and dehumanizing—a tragedy in its own right.
> 
> "But Charlotte was not a joke. She was not content. She was a child—a daughter, a friend, a soul in pain who still smiled, still shared jokes, still had dreams. She loved art, music, and expressing herself online in the only ways she felt safe. Charlotte had so much left to do, so much left to say, and so much love left to give.
> 
> "Charlotte lived in a world where being different often meant being targeted. She lived in a society that criminalized her identity and vilified her truth. Yet through all of that, she dared to be herself. That, in itself, was an act of courage.
> 
> "Her death is not just a personal loss, but a societal failure—a reminder of the urgent need for compassion, mental health care, and safety for transgender youth. According to national data, transgender teens like Charlotte face staggering rates of depression, rejection, and suicide. But none of it is inevitable. Every life lost is one we could have saved."
