> 27-YEAR-OLD MAN TAKES HIS OWN LIFE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN BAYAMON.
> 
> Las Voces Del Sur Official - Agents from the Puerto Rico Police Bureau investigated a suicide reported at approximately 6:21 p.m. yesterday, Sunday, at a residence located in the Guaraguao Arriba neighborhood of Bayamón.
> 
> According to preliminary information, a call to the 911 Emergency System alerted the police to the incident. Upon arriving at the residence, officers found a man identified by family members as 27-year-old Nathaniel Pabón Cruz, who had taken his own life at the scene.
> 
> Officer Ninoshka González, assigned to the Dajaos precinct, conducted the preliminary investigation and referred the case to Officer Iván Abraham, assigned to the Homicide Division of the Bayamón Criminal Investigation Corps, who, along with Prosecutor Glorimar García, took charge of the investigation.
> 
> “If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed or considering suicide, it is important to seek help. You can call the PAS Line at 1-800-981-0023 (1-888-672-7622 TDD) 24 hours a day, seven days a week, free of charge and confidential.”




> We want to recognize Nathaniel Pabón Cruz for his work during his years of collaboration and conspiracy with LSC and Gesta Amatista. His contributions were invaluable, and his perspectives were always precious to our team.  
> 
> Nata focused on topics that were largely overlooked in his time, such as problematic substance use, harm reduction practices, transmedicalism, and disability justice. One of his central ideas was the “Jáyate Fest,” an event developed through our Gesta Amatista, a disability justice project from La Sombrilla Cuir. Recently, Nata had founded his own project with other trans people, called “Archivo Cuir,” which has given a more subversive twist to the preservation of dissident gender and sexual memory. 
> 
> His passing is deeply felt, and we embrace all those who knew him and were close to him. We want to honor his memory today and always. It will be our commitment as comrades in the struggle to continue his impact and legacy.  
> 
> May she rest in power, Nata Pabón Cruz.

> Meanwhile, Nathaniel Pabón Cruz, a student and activist for the rights of non-binary and trans people at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras, mentioned that upon reading about Alexa's [Luciano Ruiz] murder, his first reaction was to scream in pain because he had expected it.   
> 
> “I don’t want visibility,” Pabón Cruz remarked. “What I want is for everyone to be treated as human beings and to have rights, and for them to listen to us when we speak to others.” 
> 
> "Give the microphone to the people who need it when necessary: ??to people who actually know about our experiences," he pointed out.
