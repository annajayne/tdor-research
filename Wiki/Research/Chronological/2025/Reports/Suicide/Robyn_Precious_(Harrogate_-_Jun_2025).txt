> TransFutures Episode Eleven. Robyn Precious, a young trans advocate for the NHS, shares his journey so far.  Robyn describes the benefit of the support he had at a young age from his family who allowed him to explore his gender, be who he is and accept himself.  He talks about the positive impact of supportive initiatives within his local NHS service for young people such as a youth forum, LGBT+ staff networks and trans policy.  We talk about his experience of trans healthcare, accessing hormones and what he would like to see change to improve services.  We also discuss the importance of LGBT+ education and raising awareness of trans issues with the cisgender community.
