> Transgender Russian Woman Dies at Dutch Asylum Shelter - The Moscow Times
> A 17-year-old transgender Russian woman died Saturday at a refugee camp in the Netherlands, according to the LGBT Asylum Support organization, which assists LGBTQ+ asylum seekers.
> 
> Alisa Serova died after an alleged drug overdose, the organization said, adding that she had been left alone and lacked access to hormone therapy or psychological care at the shelter. She was also unable to contact her caseworker at the center for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, the group said.
> 
> On the day of her death, other refugees at the camp alerted staff at the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) that Serova was “barely breathing.” An ambulance was called only after a second check, by which time she was “probably already dead,” according to LGBT Asylum Support.
> 
> The media outlet VotTak reported that Serova never regained consciousness and died in intensive care.
> 
> A fellow resident at the camp told VotTak that Serova was housed in a section where minors were not supposed to stay and that she had confided thoughts of suicide the day before her overdose. Another resident, also speaking anonymously, said Serova struggled with the language barrier.
> 
> Unconfirmed reports claimed Serova had been raped at the camp when she was 16, during her first month there.
> 
> At least six LGBTQ+ Russians have died in Dutch refugee camps since the start of the war in Ukraine, VotTak reported. One of the most recent cases was the death of Antonina Babkina, a transgender Russian woman who had sought asylum in the Netherlands.



> Minor trans asylum seeker tragically dies in neglected condition in an adult shelter
> 
> LGBT Asylum Support sends 12th urgent letter about negligent government to Minister Faber
> 
> Amsterdam, [1 April 2025] – LGBT Asylum Support has sent a 12th urgent letter to Minister Faber van Asiel and Migration following the tragic death of minor trans asylum seeker Alice. Alice, who sought asylum in December 2023 after fleeing Russia, was placed in an adult shelter without the necessary guidance despite her vulnerable status.
> 
> On December 28, 2023 Alice became a victim of a rape in the azc Ter Apel. Despite repeated reports of her suicidal expressions, she initially received insufficient care from the COA as a victim. Following her transfer to AZC Amsterdam, her condition worsened due to neglect and lack of support, which ultimately led to her passing on 27 March 2025.
> 
> Sandro Kortekaas, chairman of LGBT Asylum Support, stressed: "It is unacceptable that a minor is left to her fate like this in a shelter meant for adults. "The organization is calling on the government to conduct a thorough investigation and advocate for separate shelter facilities with intensive guidance for vulnerable LGBT+ asylum seekers and for underage queer asylum seekers in order to prevent such tragedies."
> 
> The full urgent letter is online on the foundation's website. The family has asked us to be restrained.
