> Kia-Leigh Tabitha Roberts, a proud transgender woman, was born on December 5, 1969, in Pasadena, Texas, and passed away from suicide on June 24, 2025, in West Valley, Utah. She lived with courage, honesty, and deep emotional strength through years of depression and the systemic injustices faced by many in the transgender community.
> 
> Shy but sweet, Kia-Leigh was known for her warmth, her intellect, and her desire to connect with others. She was a friend to many.
> 
> She loved engaging with the transgender community in all capacities, especially circles of trans sisterhood, and often opened her heart to share what she experienced. She was close with her friend Jeri Linford, who was a source of light in her life. We all can learn from her bravery and resilience in speaking her truth amidst life’s struggles.
> 
> Kia-Leigh’s life was a testament to spirited resistance and the everyday courage of living authentically. She died during Pride Month, a time of celebration and reflection for the LGBTQ+ community, and a reminder of how vital support, connection, and care are to those who are struggling. If you or someone you know is struggling, please call or text 988, or reach out to Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860, peer support by and for the trans community.
> 
> She had a special fondness for her dog Simba the Second, red lipstick, watermelon-flavored gum, LiveWire Mountain Dew, manicures, and the character Tigger from Winnie the Pooh, whose boundless energy and joy mirrored her own playful spirit.
> 
> Kia-Leigh was well-read; she loved literature. As an imaginative and creative soul, she found deep meaning in science fiction, drawn to the imagined futures of Star Trek and Star Wars, where chosen families thrive and new worlds hold space for everyone. She saw herself in these universes, where differences were destiny and chosen families were written into the stars.
> 
> Observant and introspective, she lived in awe of the transgender people who came before her, those who paved the way through resistance, artistry, and survival. Kia-Leigh carried their stories close to her heart, honoring them through her own journey, her poetry, and her quiet acts of visibility and care.
> 
> Kia-Leigh was a lifelong learner. She studied electrology at Cameo College of Essential Beauty in Murray, Utah, and dreamed of helping others through permanent hair removal, an affirming service to help others feel at home in their bodies. She loved working and learning alongside others in a salon atmosphere. She loved the sisterhood feel of the school and treasured the friendships with many of her instructors, especially Anna Hernandez-Ray. She approached the trade with attention to detail and heart, encouraging others to pursue their own paths.
> 
> Academically gifted, she attended Utah Valley Community College (now Utah Valley University), where she earned an Associate’s Degree. She later transferred to Brigham Young University, proudly graduating with a bachelor’s degree in English. Her love of language and expression blossomed into poetry, much of which explored her transition and her pursuit of becoming her highest self.
> 
> Ever the wordsmith, she served a Spanish-speaking mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Los Angeles, California, Mission. Her spirituality remained an important part of her life. She truly honored the spirit of Love One Another. She is remembered by many for her philosophies about life, outlooks on the world and humanity, and for sharing her insights and inner workings.
> 
> She had been previously married and shared many years with her ex-wife, Trichelle, with whom she raised four children: Tyler, Alexis, Olivia, and Abigail. Parenthood was of great importance to her; Kia-Leigh’s heart was enormous, and she loved all of her children immensely. Being a grandparent brought her joy, and she wished the world for her grandchildren.
> 
> She is survived by her children, her granddaughters Emberly and Hadley, her expected grandson Caspian, countless online friends and penpals, and her beloved chosen family within the LGBTQ+ community. She is also survived by her brothers, Tracy Roberts (LaVieve) and Joseph Roberts (Kayla), along with her nieces and nephews. She was preceded in death by her parents, Robert Roberts Sr. and Karen Ann Olsen Roberts; her brothers, Robert Roberts Jr. and Dale Roberts; and her sisters, Jeanne Roberts and Valerie James.
> 
> Kia-Leigh once had the word hope painted on her fingernails by a nail artist, a courageous gesture to remind herself and others to always foster hope. May we also use hope as a tool to shape a kinder, more just world. May we all readily keep hope at our fingertips, as inspiration to build a better world, strengthen communities, and spread abundant hope in Kia-Leigh’s honor.
> 
> A celebration of life will be held on Saturday, August 16th at 5 p.m. at the Sun Trapp, 102 S 600 W. Organized by Dal Rivas of the Glitter Foundation, which is exploring ways to support those who are struggling and feeling overwhelmed, so no one feels alone in their darkest moments. Spaghetti and salad will be served. Together we can create space for grief, healing, and community. Kia-Leigh’s memory deserves light, love, and action and we honor her by showing up for one another.
