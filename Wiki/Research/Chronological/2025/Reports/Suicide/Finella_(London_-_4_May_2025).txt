possible suicide


> I'd like to report a death that occurred in London, UK this year on May 4th. It is a possible suicide of a trans woman called Finella/Finnela (she used both spellings), my ex-partner. She was 26.
> 
> She started exploring her gender around 2019, but had a transphobic family and socially detransitioned for about 4-5 years before starting to come to terms with her transness again in 2024-2025. She personally contacted me about it, but only a few weeks later 
> 
> she was found dead in her room. She had bipolar disorder and epilepsy. Because of the epilepsy, it's not clear whether it was suicide or the result of a seizure. But I think suicide was ruled to be more likely.
> 
> She was unfortunately buried under her old name. I don't know if she tried to talk to her family about it again or not. But she was known as Finella to her friends. I would like her to be honoured in her chosen name. Would it be possible to add her to this year's list? Due to the way her family is, I think first name only would be best. There aren't any news reports as far as I know. There is a memorial website from her family but it's in her old name, so I'd rather not share it publicly, though I can share it with you if that's necessary for confirmation.
> 
> If you need more information or corroboration from anyone else, please let me know and I'll get back to you. I'm currently trying to see if any of her friends would like to submit messages to be featured on the website. I'll try to have something put together in the next few days.
