> Heartbroken family of trans teen speaks out about how bullying led to his death
> Nov 17
> 
> The family of a young trans student from Iowa who took his own life earlier this month, has spoken out about the bullying he faced during his short life.
> 
> Fifteen-year-old Miles Phipps died on 4 November, prompting more than 150 pupils at Urbandale High School to walk out in support of his family and to call for more kindness. 
> 
> His mother, Ashley Campbell, told the Des Moines Register that he had been bullied in and out of school for years. He had tried to end his own life twice, even before attending the school.
> 
> “Protecting trans kids is important but so is not being cruel, just being understanding,” she said. “I think it’s a bigger issue than just gender. My child couldn’t handle it because that was what he was bullied [about] the most. He never should have had to endure that.”
> 
> Miles’ death came a day after a substitute teacher refused to use his preferred pronouns. Eleven months earlier, his family had informed the school that he was trans. School principal Tim Carver informed other parents and guardians in an email and directed them to resources, emphasising that counselling would be available to students.
> 
> “Our thoughts will continue to be with Miles’ family,” he has said. ”Please be sure to reach out if you or your child would benefit from additional support. We are here to help.”
> 
> Officials from the Urbandale Community School District said they remained “steadfast in our dedication to cultivating a safe, caring and supportive learning environment for all students and staff”.
> 
> According to a survey for The Trevor Project, across the US in 2024, 39 per cent of LGBTQ+ youngsters, aged between 13 and 24 – including 46 per cent of transgender and non-binary young people – had “seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year”.
> 
> ‘You are enough. No matter what they say, you’re worthy’
> The lyrics of a song, called “Love Worthy”, shared by Ashley read: “Even when the world feels cold and rough, you got to know that you are enough. No matter what they say, you’re worthy. Loved in every way. Just hold on and don’t give up ‘cuz you are, you are loved.”
> 
> Miles’ father Rocky Phipps told the Register: “If I could give one message to all the kids, [it’s] if you see someone bullying another person, call them out. Bullies don’t like to be called out. Always be kind because you never know what that person is going through.”
> 
> A GoFundMe has been launched to help the Phipps and Campbell families with funeral and memorial expenses, including the siting of a park bench outside Miles’ favourite place, the Urbandale Library. 
> 
> The GoFundMe remembers him as “a kind, talented and creative soul who expressed himself through music” [who] loved “skateboarding, bicycling and spending time outdoors”.
> 
> It goes on to say: “Miles was a proud transgender male who was driven, and faced the world with courage, authenticity and grace, even in the face of bullying and misunderstanding. He is deeply loved and will forever be cherished by his family. His parents and older sister will forever celebrate his laughter, his music and his beautiful heart.”




> On Tuesday 150+ students walked out to support Miles family and call for action. Miles family came and spoke with the students. I think the most moving part of the walkout, and vigil on Sunday, was kids and adults talking about Miles and sharing their own personal stories.
> 
> As parents we don't know how many people our kids chat with every single day. With Miles every kid and adult had a inside joke or special bond. From the teacher who Miles helped ride a skateboard to the family members taking him out for his birthday. Even the stories of Miles sharing snacks and laughing at the lunch table I hope bring a smile to his family.
> 
> I know each of those stories helps their family. If you knew Miles please share a story here of him. If you didn't know him please give some support in the comments to others. Lets show his family and friends our overwhelming support. Tell his family what he meant to you and how much you'll miss him.
> 
> Remember we haven't seen many trolls but we don't respond to them. We don't debate people who don't share a base of human empathy. Downvote, report, and comment something positive on someone else's post.




> In honor of Miles life we would like to save up some money to honor a bench in his favorite spot at the library and possibly a tree.
> All 15 years Miles was here, he was so amazing in every way and he was so loved by so many people and he made an impact on everyone. He never hurt a soul and he would always make someone smile with the guitar in his hands or the fuzzy worms he would place around the house. I will miss you every single day of my life and we will never ever forget you. We love you so much brother, fly high
