> They kicked Lia Smith off the Middlebury College Swimming and Diving team for being trans and now, as the 2026 season kicks off, she's dead. Rest in power, Lia. The world is so cruel sometimes.

> This is not well informed. Lia & I dove together at Midd, and while any sports team can be a difficult environment for a trans person, Lia was supported by the athletic department, all divers in the league, and our coach, though federal legislation posed extra challenges for Lia to participate. Lia was not kicked off the team, and was on the roster to participate this year, expressing excitement to get on the boards. In Lia’s memory can we please redirect this effort to protecting trans lives
