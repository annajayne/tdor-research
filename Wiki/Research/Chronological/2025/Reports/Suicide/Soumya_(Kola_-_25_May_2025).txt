> 
> In a heartbreaking incident on Sunday night, 22-year-old Soumya, also known as Chotu Yadav, was found dead in his room in Kolar, Bhopal, after allegedly committing suicide. Soumya, who had been living with a live-in partner, Danish, in a room at Mangalwara Toli, was discovered hanging from the ceiling by his partner. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors declared him dead.
> 
> While the police have registered a case of suicide, the exact reason behind the tragic incident remains unclear. During the investigation, Soumya's aunt made a startling revelation, stating that Soumya was not a eunuch, as many had believed. She claimed that Soumya had started living as a eunuch after joining a community in Mangalwara Toli but had never been a eunuch by birth. Additionally, she mentioned that Soumya had been talking about committing suicide for the past three days, which raised concerns about his mental state in the days leading up to the incident.
> 
> According to the Kolar Police, Soumya, who was originally from Abbas Nagar, had been staying with Danish, an auto driver, for some time. His family lived nearby. The police found no suicide note at the scene, and the investigation is ongoing.
> 
> The police are focusing on the recent events that might have led to this drastic step. Danish, Soumya's live-in partner, is expected to be questioned further, as he may hold critical information regarding the issues Soumya was facing in his personal life. The investigation aims to uncover any problems that may have led Soumya to take such a tragic decision.
> 
> This incident raises several questions about mental health and societal pressures, and the police are working to gather more details before determining the cause behind Soumya's tragic death.
> 
> In a separate incident 18-year-old Vishal Tomar took his life by jumping from the fifth floor of his home in Nishatpura area late Sunday night, following a heated argument with his parents. The teenager, who had left school after failing Class 10, reportedly locked his parents out of their BDA Colony residence before making the tragic decision.
