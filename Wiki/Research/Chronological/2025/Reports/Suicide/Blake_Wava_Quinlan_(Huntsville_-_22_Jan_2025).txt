> Hello, 
> 
> I was wondering if you could add Blake Wava Quinlan from Huntsville, Ontario, Canada to your list for this past year. I believe they died by suicide and their mom whom they were close with posted things on her Facebook that led me to believe this was true although  I have not confirmed this with the family to be certain. This is their obituary

> https://www.mitchellfuneralhome.ca/obituaries-1/2025/1/28/blake-wava-quinlan 
> 
> This was text from their mom's Facebook post that led me to believe they died by suicide: My grief has taken over and frozen me in place.
> 
> I feel at a loss as to who to trust with ALL of the emotions in this desperate time of need.
> 
> I'm scared of the world that I feel destroyed my child.
> 
> I'm angry at myself for not being a better mother and providing what they needed to survive in this world.
> 
> I'm sad for the loss of all the authenticity and love that they provided to the world in their short 19 years life.
> 
> I'm grateful to those who have presented themselves as supports, beacons of light and hope that there might be a chance for a better world.
> 
> The multitude of feelings that Blake's life and death has evoked is more then my shoulders can bare.
> 
> So, as I've done for the last 15 days, again, today, I wait for these and so many other feelings to make their way through me and through all those that were impacted by Blake's existence until I can move again.
> 
> Take care of those you love.
> 
> 
> If you want more information about them or their life I'm happy to discuss further as well.


//Quotes://

> Blake was a wonderful person. We had known each other for a long time, and they inspired me and those around them to be unabashedly themselves. The world was lucky to have them for the period it did, and i will remember them forever. My deepest condolences to their friends and family.

 
> May you who love Blake be showered with blessings in this painful time. Kate, loving mother, you are worthy of more kindness than you can understand, and then heaps more compassion on top. My hope is that you will keep your hands and your heart open to receive what you need, and your fingers and heartstrings taut so that all else slips right through.


> I worked with Blake - albeit briefly at Starbucks - but they were always fun and amusing. I am absolutely stunned to hear Blake's gone. I fully expected to see Blake at/involved with JC Superstar. I will miss seeing Blake's cheerful and friendly personality come to stock up on Fatface socks. My condolences to Blake's entire family over their loss.


> I was saddened to hear of the loss of such an intelligent, empathetic, creative, mature beyond years, warm and caring person. I taught Blake in grade 6, and they were the kind of student you never forget! Blake, may you shine just as brightly where you have landed, as you did here. Healing thoughts go to Blake’s family and many friends
