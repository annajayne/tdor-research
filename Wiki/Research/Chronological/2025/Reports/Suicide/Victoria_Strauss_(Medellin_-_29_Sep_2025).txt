> The anguished final hours of the trans leader who was found dead in Medellín.
> The city's LGBTQ+ movement mourns the passing of Victoria Strauss, the trans woman who built leadership in academia but also exercised it on the streets.
> 
> Victoria Strauss had a rare combination: she had made the topic of non-binary gender identities a subject of study within the university settings where she worked, while also advocating for the rights of this population on the streets. She thus gained widespread recognition not only in Medellín but throughout the country. For this reason, several human rights organizations and members of the LGBTIQ+ movement mourned her death on Tuesday .
> 
> "It's a huge loss for the city and the LGBTQ+ movement. In recent years, she's been a very significant voice, successfully combining academia with street activism. She's been reflecting on the role of trans bodies in Medellín and demanding recognition of gender identities ," said Wilson Castañeda, spokesperson for the organization Caribe Afirmativo.
> 
> For his part, Jaques León Bracamonte, of the National Network of LGBTIQ+ Peace Counselors, emphasized that Victoria was a visible and uncomfortable presence in the face of structural gender violence and a tireless advocate for the lives of non-binary people. "She was very loved by her colleagues," he noted.

>
> Initially, the human rights foundation Sumapaz also expressed its demand for justice in this case, while highlighting the role Victoria had played as a "renowned university professor, leader, and activist," as she had initially been reported missing on Monday.
> 
> Sources consulted by EL COLOMBIANO confirmed that the complaint about his absence was filed by a sister of his who lives in Bogotá, and thus the search route was activated by the Secretariat of Peace and Human Rights of the Medellín Mayor's Office, in coordination with the Diversity Management.
> 
> This was because something apparently didn't fit, as Victoria had remained silent, had left her home in the Villahermosa neighborhood, and hadn't returned calls to several close friends.
> 
> Furthermore, on Sunday, she had been admitted to the CES Clinic with severe depression and left the medical center that same day because she refused treatment and signed a waiver.
> 
> "They managed to speak with some friends and close associates and began to identify her movements around the city. Finally, the final clues led them to Santa Elena," Wilson Castañeda noted.
> 
> Accompanied by an officer who resides in the same district, the police officers assigned to the Santa Elena station entered a forest in the area late at night and around 9:00 p.m. on Monday found Victoria's lifeless body. She had allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself with a rope from a tree.
> 
> Apparently, she used her cell phone to send her approximate location and even expressed her intention to take her own life; but those who wanted to help her were unable to locate her before she committed the act.
> 
> "We ask the public to respect her will. It must be said that Medellín and the country have lost such a significant activist," Castañeda reiterated.
> 
> We also suggest you read: Attacks against the LGBTIQ+ population in Medellín have reportedly increased by 33% in 2024.
> 
> A life of activism
> Victoria would have turned 30 on October 5th. She was a peace counselor from 2017 to 2019, held a degree in political science from the University of Antioquia, and also worked as a professor in higher education. Those who knew her say that in this academic setting, she always asserted her identity as a trans woman and used every opportunity she could to generate reflection on the place of trans people in academia.
> 
> "Her writings always nurtured this reflection, but she wasn't a trans woman who was overshadowed by academia. Instead, she articulated this with street work and support for homeless people in the trans community. She supported many spaces in Commune 13 and Commune 10 (downtown)," the Caribe Afirmativo spokesperson emphasized.
> 
> Additionally, after the torture and murder of fellow trans woman Sara Millerey González Borja last April, she received widespread public attention, criticizing the way her partner's suffering went viral on social media while audiences assumed the role of complicit spectators due to the lack of action.
> 
> Likewise, Victoria led several discussions in Bello, where the transmission occurred, seeking answers from authorities about what preventive policies they had in place for gender-based violence.
> 
> But their questions also went further, highlighting the relationship between being trans and being poor in the metropolitan area.

> 
> "Her life was a constant revolution in love, in the radical tenderness she radiated. She shone fearlessly, paving the way for many in the defense of life and the human rights of the trans and transvestite population in the city of Medellín," stated Jacques León Bracamonte.

Victoria was a political scientist, a tireless worker for life, for dignity, for respect for differences. Her struggle was always marked by one certainty: love in and from difference, the revolution of small things. Her voice remains in us, in us, in all of us. Her example, her joy, her respect, her immense capacity to spread love and to remind us that serving others is also an act of resistance. Today we mourn her absence and raise our voices, giving thanks for those lives that teach us to love. Thank you, Victoria, for so much. You leave us seeds that will continue to flourish in every struggle, in every act of love, in every difference celebrated.”
