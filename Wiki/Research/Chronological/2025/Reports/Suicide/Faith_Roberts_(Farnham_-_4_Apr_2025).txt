> a friend of mine who had been studying at university took her own life on the 4th of april this year. she attributed it in the note she left to a combination of childhood trauma, and dysphoria, she felt hopeless in her transition, her name was Faith Roberts, her birthday was the 16th of september 2005, she was only 19 at the time, and the only online acknowledgement of her death is the note she left, there haven't been news reports no matter how long i've looked and i just want her to be remembered and acknowledged



> i wasn't strong enough. i didn't deserve to call myself a girl. i'm sorry everyone. unrelated to this super sad message, i reallyyy fucking suck at english lolll this message is super grammatically incorrect but im too tired to fix it
