> We lost Cansu...
> 
> A trans woman friend, Cansu C., ended her life last night in Alsancak, Izmir. There is a deep pain in our hearts and a great anger in us.
> Cansu resisted the violence, discrimination and ignoring that many trans women were forced to live in this society. But this world didn't offer him a place to live... This order, which isolates her, does not give her a living space, and does not protect her, took Cansu away from us.
> 
> Trans suicides are political! Cansu's departure is a result of the injustice and desperation that trans people are subjected to in this country. He just wanted to live. But a society fueled by hatred did not even leave him a place to breathe.
> 
> We will not only mourn after Cansu, we will continue to fight for her! A world where trans people are not alone, where they can live without fear, where they are equal and free is possible, and we will not stop until we build that world!
> 
> We will not forget Cansu and all our trans brothers and sisters who have been torn from our lives by hatred and marginalization. It is our responsibility to keep their memory alive, to continue their struggle, and to fight for a world where trans people can live equal, free and dignified lives.
> We would like to express our condolences to Cansu's family, friends and the entire trans+ community. We are not alone, we will never be alone.

> The November 20 Hate Crimes Combating Association has published a public information statement regarding the intense police pressure that trans women living in Alsancak, Izmir are subjected to. The association’s statement stated that for the last two months, arbitrary fines have been imposed on trans women for “having a criminal record check” and that these practices continue unlawfully.
> 
> The statement stated that the identity information of trans women was used arbitrarily, and that reports were kept by showing that they had passed through streets they had not passed through. It was also emphasized that the houses where trans women were sheltered were targeted by criminalizing them under various pretexts, and that law enforcement officers were specifically monitoring these houses. It was stated that law enforcement officers were keeping watch in front of the houses of trans women on Bornova Street and its surroundings, exposing the shelters, and taking the trans women to the police station and trying to get their statements under pressure.
