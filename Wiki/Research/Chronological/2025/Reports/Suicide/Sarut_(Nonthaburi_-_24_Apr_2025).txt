> Thai transwoman commits suicide after losing 7 million baht in scam
> A Thai transwoman committed suicide in her parked car outside her barbecue restaurant in Nonthaburi province, near Bangkok, after reportedly losing over 7 million baht in an investment scam.
> 
> A worker at the restaurant in Bang Kruai district noticed the vehicle belonging to his transgender employer, Sarut, parked outside unusually early on the morning of April 24. He became suspicious, as she had never arrived that early before.
> 
> The staff searched the premises but found no sign of Sarut. Initially, they dismissed the matter until receiving a phone call from her older brother, who reported her missing. The worker then rushed to check inside the car and discovered her lifeless body, subsequently notifying Bang Kruai Police Station.
> 
> Rescue personnel and a medical team from the Institute of Forensic Medicine reported that the transwoman was found dead in the driver’s seat of her white GWM Haval SUV. There were no visible wounds or signs of a struggle. She was believed to have died approximately eight to ten hours before discovery.
> 
> A charcoal stove was found on the footwell of the back seat, leading officers to suspect suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.
> 
> A close friend told Channel 7 that Sarut was a kind and generous person, well-liked in the community. She was known for her friendliness and for regularly feeding stray cats in the area.
> 
> The friend added that Sarut had repeatedly spoken about her financial struggles. They last met on the night before her death.
> 
> Following interviews with other friends and family members, police learned that the transwoman had lost over 7 million baht in an investment scam. She did not only spend her life savings on the fraudulent scheme but also borrowed significant sums from others to fund what turned out to be a fake business.
> 
> Creditors reportedly confronted her several times, demanding repayment, adding to her stress. Sarut often told her friends that she wanted to end her life to escape the situation, though none believed she would act on it.
> 
> Police reviewed the restaurant’s CCTV footage and discovered that Sarut unplugged all the cameras before taking her own life in the car.
>
