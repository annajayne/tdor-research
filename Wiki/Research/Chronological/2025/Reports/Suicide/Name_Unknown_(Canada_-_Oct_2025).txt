> I have not seen any Canadian statistics on the reports this year or last year. As a transgender woman who works for a Sexual Health Centre, I am aware of a suicide just last month [October], and a person who is missing following an arson of their home also last month. There is clearly violence and hate crimes occurring against Canadian Trans Community members, but I do not see any statistics included in your PowerPoint, map, or collage. Can you explain this?
