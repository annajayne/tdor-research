> Dorothy was a dear friend of mine. We met in person through politics and a shared love for dark and heavy music. For years, our paths crisscrossed but never truly met. I learned later that the reason I so seldomly saw her throughout those years was connected with her going through a very dark period and not being able to cope with living.
> 
> She moved back to Budapest, in her home country of Hungary at a time where being a trans woman was and is dangerous. Throughout the years there, our online tendencies and joint passion for similar music put us in touch together, this time less superficially, not just about an album we liked, but opening up to each other and checking in on each other. There, she managed to produce and release quite a lot of music, at first under the moniker Dorothy Waste and later as Meet Me After Sundown. She also managed to find a place to perform live in Budapest. I remember receiving the news of how excited she was with having found a place she felt at home to play live.
> 
> Around three years ago she met her partner, with whom she stayed until the end [they will remain unnamed]. I still remember the joy radiating from her texts shortly after their first date. Mostly, I remember years later, having moved in together, receiving a text saying the place she lived felt like home for the first time in her life. She had been addressing her mental health and addiction issues throughout the years and through music and love seemed to be finding her place.
> 
> Unfortunately, the world had other plans. Dorothy and her partner had to move away from Hungary for fear of persecution due to being trans. They found a home in France, although I never learned where. She kept releasing music until shortly after her death. She kept being kind and wonderful and checkin in with her friends until less than a month before she passed away. She is dearly missed.
