> ZURÍ WAS ATTENDING NIGHT SCHOOL.
> Police and the courts are investigating the causes that led a young transgender student to take her own life on the banks of the Paraná River in the city of Bella Vista. A neighbor discovered her body hanging from a tree, with the unusual feature still being her uniform from the city's Teachers' College. They are trying to determine whether the young woman had been suffering bullying because of her gender, or if a family problem was the trigger, as her relatives did not claim the body, which had been in the morgue for more than 12 hours.
> 
> At around 12:20 a.m. yesterday, a resident of Citricultores Avenue, in the southern part of the city, almost adjacent to the Paraná River, alerted the Second Police Station of the gruesome discovery. The man described how he had come across the body of a young person "hanging from a small tree" at a height of two meters.
> 
> When the police commission arrived at the scene, they confirmed the incident and notified prosecutor Ramón Alfredo Muth, who minutes later summoned experts and forensic doctors to begin gathering information about what had happened.
> 
> In an interview with Radio Bella Vista, Deputy Commissioner Fernández, head of the town's Second Police Station, clarified the rumors surrounding the case, stating that forensic experts from Regional Unit II confirmed that the body had died of "asphyxiation by hanging" and that there were no signs of having been beaten, much less sexually abused, as initially reported after the news broke.
> 
> Fernández also highlighted the fact that the victim was still wearing the Bella Vista Teacher Training School uniform, which she wore at night, and it was there that investigators began investigating her final hours.
> 
> Yesterday, it was also confirmed that the victim is a young transgender woman, identified as Mía Zurí Gutiérrez Ramírez, 20, who, according to sources consulted by the newspaper Época, had some family problems due to her condition.
> 
> After the autopsy, the body was taken to the Bella Vista Hospital morgue, but nearly 12 hours passed before family members claimed it. This happened after the police contacted them based on information they had gathered throughout the morning. The investigation was handed over to the local prosecutor's office in a case currently classified as "alleged suicide."


 
 
> The chief of the Bella Vista Second Police Station, Eduardo Fernández, spoke with Ñande Cable and shared details of the case they are investigating regarding the death of a young woman in that town. "The prosecutor was present at the scene with the expert, as well as the coroner from the city of Goya, who stated that the death was caused by asphyxiation by hanging," he said, referring to the initial findings of the investigation. "At the time, they ruled out any type of sexual assault," he emphasized. 
> 
> "She was wearing a regular school uniform and was believed to be a 20-year-old trans girl from this town. Her last name was Gutiérrez," he explained.
> 
> He also confirmed that after the investigation, "it was possible to locate legal relatives and the necessary procedures are currently being followed."



> The discovery of the body of a 20-year-old trans woman, dressed in her school uniform, in the area of ??De los Citricultores Avenue and the Paraná River, in Bella Vista, caused a stir this morning.
> 
> Initial reports indicate that the body was found hanging, and that a suspected suicide is being investigated.
> 
> However, it also emerged that the body showed signs of alleged sexual abuse, in addition to being badly beaten. She was wearing the Teacher Training School uniform and no sneakers.
> 
> Around noon, the body was in the local hospital morgue, and experts from Goya were expected to begin further studies.
