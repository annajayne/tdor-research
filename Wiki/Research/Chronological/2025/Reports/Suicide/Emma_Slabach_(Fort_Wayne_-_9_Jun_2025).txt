> emma was the sweetest girl i’ve ever met, and that’s all i ever knew her as. her energy lit up every room she entered. you could tell her anything and she would listen to you without judgement. it’s a shame this world and the people in it treated her the way they did.



> Owen Thomas Slabach, 24, of Ft. Wayne, Indiana passed away Monday, June 9, 2025, from his battle with mental health and addiction. Addiction is serious. Addiction can kill. Just because someone is smiling and willing to try to make everyone else happy doesn’t mean that they’re okay. Growing up, he endured so much and was always so strong. His battle with mental health started at a very young age - he had to go through trials that not even people of old age ever have to deal with. He once was the shyest one in the room, and then one day his confidence blossomed him into a confident young man. He always knew how to bring a smile to your face. He could always entertain. He always loved hardcore. There weren’t any signs that he would fall to addiction. There weren’t signs that his mental health would so drastically change because of his addiction. There weren’t any signs that he would quite literally become a whole other person due to addiction. There was pain and struggle and love, and a desire to be loved and be seen, apparently no matter the cost. Just because someone is smiling doesn’t mean they’re okay. The loudest laugh and biggest smile in the room might just be holding the most pain of all.

> Born April 15, 2001, he was the son of Jeremy and Tracy Slabach. Owen graduated from Northrop High School in 2019 and attended Purdue Fort Wayne for his freshman year. Owen moved to South Bend where he excelled as a Sales Associate and Ambassador for Verizon. Owen loved music and performing. He had an ear for music from a very young age. Picking up his PaBow’s guitar as a young toddler and strumming the strings for the first time and minutes later the tune of Happy Birthday could be heard being plucked slowly from the strings. Owen had a deep love for all things gaming and a natural talent for technology. When he wasn’t on stage delivering powerful performances, he could often be found behind a screen, mastering complex game mechanics, building custom PCs, or exploring the latest in cutting-edge tech. He is also survived by his sister, Evelyn (Benjamin) Short; brother, Justin McDonald; grandparents, Thomas and Carolyn Marhoover; nephews, Braxtyn and Roman Short; uncles, Richard (Ronetta) Marhoover, Cliff (Cheryl) Miller, Doug (Dawn) Slabach, Loren Miller, Scotland Slabach; aunts, Vietta (Doug) Delagrange, Monica (Kevin) Gingerich, Bonnie (Josh) Roth; cousins, Emily Marhoover, Cole (Britney) Miller, Collin Miller, Carsten Miller, Christian Miller, Greta Slabach, Juliana Slabach, Stephanie (Jesse) Workman, Krista (Dustin) Washler, Evan (Janelle) Delagrange, Erica Gingerich, Logan Gingerich, Caleb (Tenille) Roth, Kallie Roth and Corbin Roth; and numerous other great aunts and uncles and cousins.
