suicide


> A 24-year-old individual, identified as Rahul alias Rakhi, a transgender person from Jhalawar, tragically died by suicide after hanging themselves in their rented accommodation in the Bhanpur Multi area under Chola Mandir police station limits. The decomposed body was discovered by police on Wednesday after neighbors reported the closed gate of the rented room for two consecutive days.
> 
> The incident has brought to light a poignant dispute over the deceased's identity. While a large number of transgender individuals gathered at the mortuary, asserting that Rahul had fully embraced a transgender identity and worked within their community, the family claims that the deceased had lived as a boy in their native village of Jhalawar.
> 
> According to police reports, Rahul, son of Ramgopal Mali, had moved to Bhopal approximately a year ago with the promise of employment in a beauty parlor. However, Sub-Inspector Mahesh Sarayam stated that Rahul later became involved with a transgender group and began begging with them, residing with the community in Bhanpur Multi.
> 
> The last known contact with Rahul was on June 7, when they spoke to their brother, Bajrang, over the phone. After this conversation, all contact ceased. Concerns grew when the rented room's gate remained shut for two consecutive days, prompting neighbors to alert the police. Upon arrival, officers were forced to break open the gate, where they discovered the decomposed body.
> 
> The family was promptly informed and arrived in Bhopal on Wednesday. The post-mortem examination was conducted in their presence, after which the body was handed over for final rites. No suicide note was recovered from the scene, leaving the precise reason behind the suicide unclear. Police have seized the deceasedâ€™s mobile phone as part of their ongoing investigation, hoping to uncover clues that might shed light on the circumstances leading to this tragic death. The case remains under active investigation as authorities work to determine the full context of the incident.
