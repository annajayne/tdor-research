> Coroner rules death of teenager at Baitings Reservoir a suicide
> Thursday 16 October 2025 at 4:51pm
> 
> A schoolgirl who had told friends she was struggling with her sexuality and religion took her life after entering a reservoir, an inquest heard.
> 
> Qudsiyah Mahmood, 13, drowned at Baitings Reservoir, near Ripponden, West Yorkshire, after asking her father to take her for a walk so she could take photographs, Bradford Coroner's Court was told.
> 
> He was walking in front of her when his daughter went over a parapet at the beauty spot on 28 May. Her body was found the following day.
> 
> Assistant Coroner Caroline Chandler ruled she had died by suicide.
> 
> The inquest heard Qudsiyah, who was born in Mirpur, Pakistan, had been showing poor mental health and had self-harmed.
> 
> On the day she died, she asked her father to take her to the reservoir, which was a regular walking destination for her family.
> 
> Det Insp Laura Hall, of West Yorkshire Police, told the inquest: "Qudsiyah had asked to visit to take photos on the bridge like she had seen on social media, although due to her father's ill-health, he warned her that they couldn't stay very long.
> 
> "Upon promising she would do well in her exams if her father took her, Mr Mahmood and Qudsiyah drove to the reservoir around lunchtime."
> 
> After taking photos by the shore, she asked to go up to the bridge.
> 
> Det Insp Hall said: "Mr Mahmood was walking slightly ahead, when he recalls feeling like something was wrong and hearing a splash."
> 
> After her death, police were given screenshots of the messages sent on Snapchat suggesting she was experiencing low mood.
> 
> Det Insp Hall said: "She was questioning whether she was gender fluid and agnostic, and also whether she was intending to take her own life.
> 
> "The family was not aware of this but told the police that, whatever the problem, they would have been supportive."
> 
> Assistant Coroner Caroline Chandler said: "Sadly, it would seem by the evidence that Qudsiyah entered the water of her own accord, stepping off the bridge. Given the exchange of messages, and that on a balance of probability, both stages of deliberation and intention have been met, my ruling is suicide."
> Following Qudsiyah's death, Dean Jones, the headteacher of Crossley Heath School in Halifax, described her as a "bright, kind and friendly young person who brought happiness to our school".
