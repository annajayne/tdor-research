> Investigation into the death of Davide Garufo: the Prosecutor's Office opens a case for incitement to suicide
>
> The Public Prosecutor's Office of Monza has launched an investigation into the tragic death of Davide Garufo , the 21-year-old known on TikTok, who died on March 19 in his home in Sesto San Giovanni , in the province of Milan. The investigation, coordinated by the prosecutor Claudio Gittardi , focuses on two hypotheses of crime: failure to store a firearm and incitement to suicide . According to what has emerged so far, the investigation is not connected to the content published on social media by the young man, where he had courageously shared his journey of gender transition .
> 
> A journey of self-determination told on social media
> Since 2020, Davide had begun to publish ironic and light-hearted content on TikTok , and then opened up more and more to his personal sphere. He had publicly talked about his transition experience, first as Alexandra , a transgender woman, and later returning to calling himself Davide , with a non-binary identity.
> 
> It is precisely at this stage that his social profiles have been the target of numerous offensive and violent comments , currently being examined by investigators. Many users have contributed to a hostile climate, with episodes that could constitute online bullying and transphobia .
> 
> The news of Davide's death has had wide media coverage and has deeply shaken the community of Sesto San Giovanni. In these hours the Italian Left party has also intervened, which in a statement expressed “ pain and anger for the death of Alex/Davide Garufo”, denouncing that the young man was “ the victim of transphobic bullying ”.
> 
> According to Sinistra Italiana, Davide did not take his own life by individual choice, but was pushed towards suicide by a society that denies and humiliates the identity of transgender and non-binary people. The delegate for rights of Sinistra Italiana Milano, Daniele Durante , declared: "I do not consider Alex's (Davide) death a suicide, but a murder with those responsible: a traditionalist, selfish society, and an intolerant culture that strikes those who simply want to be themselves".
> 
> In its statement, Sinistra Italiana expressed closeness to Davide's family, friends and followers , underlining the young man's courage in coming out as a transgender woman, announcing the start of hormone therapy and asking to be called Alexandra.
> 
> The party finally reiterated its commitment to counter transphobic hatred , promoting a culture of respect and inclusion. The declared objective is to build a more just and free society, through a strong legislative initiative in collaboration with LGBTQIA+ organizations.



> (ANSA) - ROME, MAR 24 - Monza prosecutors on Monday opened a probe into possible instigation to suicide over a 21-year-old who killed himself after being mocked and hated on social media after documenting his transition to a woman on TikTok.
> 
> The man, Davide Garufo, took his own life on March 19 in his home at Sesto San Giovanni near Milan.
> 
> But police said the probe was not directly related to the messages he received on social media.
> 
> Police said there is so far no evidence of bullying, at the current stage of the investigation, in the case.
> 
> At the moment the investigations, according to what has been learned, have not revealed reports of particular persecutory behavior, neither on the web nor reported by the family in the context of direct knowledge.
> 
> After the opening of a file by the Monza Prosecutor's Office with the hypothesis of incitement to suicide, an autopsy is awaited to define the exact causes of death.
> 
> The young man killed himself with his father's gun. The weapon was regularly held as the man works as a security guard but it would not have been adequately protected, so much so that the man was reported for careless custody of a firearm. (ANSA).
