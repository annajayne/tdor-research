> Hi! I'm Jessica, a trans woman from sunny Coventry - you might have met me at a bi or queer event (like BiCon and BiCamp), or through socialist/trade union stuff. I don't like asking for help, but I'm experiencing serious dysphoria about my gender and my body, and NHS waiting lists for Gender Identity Clinics are 4+ years for a first appointment. I can’t wait that long, and I don't know what else I can do.
> 
> I need to transition into a more "feminine" body, and NHS gender services are currently at around a 7 year wait. Additionally they may not offer the surgery I need. Going private doesn't just avoid the seven year wait, it may be the only way I can live in a body I'm comfortable in.
> 
> I'm a qualified teacher, but currently unable to work due to mental health issues including c-PTSD - I’m also hoping to raise enough money for trauma-focused therapy to start addressing this. I was recently referred to the local NHS psychological therapy service, who informed me that my needs are "too complex" for them to treat and instead recommended a Christian counselling charity. As a queer trans person with religious trauma that doesn't help.
> 
> I rely largely on Universal Credit - I try to work a few hours as a content writer, but for every £1 I earn 55p is deducted from my UC payment.
> 
> If you can contribute anything towards this I'd be very grateful. When I am back in work I will show that gratitude by contributing to similar fundraisers and community causes; any left over funds will be similarly paid forward.

> Hi everyone. I wanted to share a quick update with you all. On April 7th [2024], I experienced a brutal attack, leading to a challenging recovery process. It’s been tough, but the support and love you’ve shown have been incredible lights during this dark time.
> 
> Your generosity has been overwhelming, helping with both my healing and expenses. I can’t thank you enough for being my strength during this time.
> 
> I’m focusing on recovery, one day at a time, and your support fuels my hope and courage. I’ll keep you posted on my progress.
> 
> Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness means the world to me.
