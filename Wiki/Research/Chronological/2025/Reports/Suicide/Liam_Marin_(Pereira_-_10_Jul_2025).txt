suicide


Liam Marin died by suicide in Pereira, Risaralda (Colombia) sometime before 15 Jul 2025.

He was 16.




> The suicide of Liam Marín, a 16-year-old who jumped off the César Gaviria viaduct in Pereira, has once again raised alarms about the mental health crisis among young people, especially in vulnerable populations such as transgender people, and the shortcomings in their care.
> 
> The suicide of Liam David Marín Pineda, a 16-year-old transgender teenager who jumped off the César Gaviria viaduct in Pereira (Risaralda) on July 10, 2025, has shocked the country and exposed serious shortcomings in psychological care and an alarming reality: free mental health crisis lines either don't answer or answer too late. Liam spent nearly half an hour on the Pereira viaduct (Risaralda) while police officers and firefighters unsuccessfully tried to persuade him not to jump. But no one with specialized training arrived in time. Nor did the mental health crisis lines work.
> 
> After the news of the suicide broke, several people shared similar experiences on social media: unanswered calls, messages that were never read, and psychological appointments scheduled with weeks or even months of waiting. In Pereira, the hotline set up by the Ministry of Health has also been criticized for its low response capacity.
> 
> Revictimization
> Similar to what happened with Sara Millerey , Liam's case was captured on video and shared indiscriminately on social media by both media outlets and individuals, without considering the pain and impact this may have on his family, friends, and other trans people and adolescents. These videos are circulated and disseminated without consent or respect, often accompanied by morbid comments, mockery, or gender bias. This exposure not only violates Liam's dignity but also perpetuates violence against trans people, whose bodies are often subjected to ridicule and dehumanization even after death. Sharing these images and denying or gender bias in his identity isn't "reporting"; it's reproducing the same structural cruelty that affects the mental health of thousands of adolescents like Liam. We spoke about this with Mikaelah Drullard in our Somos Volcanes podcast episode on Transphobia and Trans-Exclusionary Discourses.
> 
> Child and adolescent suicide in Colombia: an open wound
> Liam Marín's suicide is not an isolated case. Youth mental health is facing a profound crisis in Colombia: between 2015 and 2025, at least 2,727 suicides among minors were recorded, according to data compiled by El País, equivalent to almost six adolescent or child suicides every week. The sustained increase, loneliness, violence from childhood, and social media intensify the risk. In Pereira and other intermediate cities, the lack of specialized care and stigma complicate containment. Liam's case revives the constant alert regarding mental health in Pereira, where the Ministry of Health activated hotlines, apparently without solid support.
> 
> Liam didn't die from a lack of resilience, or from a lack of determination. His death is the result of a society that singles out, stigmatizes, excludes, and violates trans children, adolescents, and lives, and of a care system that doesn't work or doesn't respond in a timely manner.
> 
> The mental health law and the intersectional approach
> Law 2460 of 2025, recently signed by President Gustavo Petro, recognizes mental health as a fundamental right in Colombia for the first time. This law—enacted two weeks before Liam's suicide—establishes direct access to psychological care without a medical referral, creates the National Mental Health System with regional networks, provides stable funding, and proposes a differentiated approach with priority for young people, women, the LGBTIQ+ population, and ethnic communities. It also establishes that all settings—schools, hospitals, prisons, workplaces, and community spaces—must incorporate psychosocial care pathways.
> 
> LGBTIQ+ people, especially trans people, face discrimination, harassment, and exclusion that exacerbate their vulnerability to emotional distress, especially during adolescence, and public policies often ignore these realities. Suicide, in many cases, can be a response to environments that reproduce violence against their identities and orientations. The pandemic and the excessive use of social media, where hate speech against trans populations grows unabated, even among accounts that claim to be human rights defenders and feminists, can accentuate the feeling of inadequacy, loneliness, and the idea that the world rejects them for who they are. It is essential to consider mental health care from a transfeminist perspective and to provide safe and empathetic spaces, also online.
> 
> For this reason, public mental health policies and protocols cannot be neutral; they must integrate inclusive care, based on respect and recognition of diverse identities. Trans adolescents face additional stigma, specific forms of violence, unsafe family environments, and barriers to accessing respectful and affirming care. If these structural conditions are not addressed, mental health will remain a privilege for the few.
> 
> Unhindered access to psychologists, the presence of trained personnel in schools, active community networks, emergency protocols based on respect and diversity, and a helpline are truly essential to containing mental health crises. But, in addition to the law, political will is needed for its effective implementation, along with sustained investment, training with a gender and intersectionality approach, and the participation of young people themselves in the design and implementation of services. Above all, we need to stop viewing suicide in vulnerable adolescents and children as an individual problem and begin to embrace it as a collective responsibility.
> 
> The promise of a country with dignified mental health must be fulfilled, putting historically ignored lives at the center.
> 
> What can we do?
> It is unacceptable that services created to save lives fail to heed the call. It is urgent to rethink mental health care and the resources available for it, strengthening institutional, educational, and community care networks. Some urgently needed actions include:
> 
> Schools and communities play a central role and must implement gender- and diversity-sensitive protocols.
> Regarding institutions, it is URGENT to improve immediate responses and care: hotlines should be open 24/7, with staff trained in crises and with a gender perspective.
> The community must also take action. To achieve this, it is key to train teachers, parents, families, and health workers in early detection, without stigma.
> Resources need to be accessible: free and frequent psychotherapy, not every three months as reported by users.
> And reinforce the intersectional approach: recognizing the specificities of gender, class, race, orientation, identity, and rural or urban condition.




> The suicide of Liam, a 16-year-old transgender teenager in Pereira, once again highlights the multiple failures in the mental health care of children and adolescents by institutions, the educational system, and society, particularly for trans children and adolescents, who are more exposed to hate speech and rejection in physical and digital environments. Can we demand justice in a case of child suicide? We can and we should. The state, various agencies, and society failed to protect this life. For Liam, justice must come in the form of prevention, not repetition.
