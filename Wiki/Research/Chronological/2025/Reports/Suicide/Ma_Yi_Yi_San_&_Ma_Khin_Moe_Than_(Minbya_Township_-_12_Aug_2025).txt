suicide


Narinjara News, August 15, 2025

On the night of August 12, two LGBT (transgender) individuals killed themselves by leaping off the bridge in Rakhine State's Minbya Township.

Today, August 14, more than two days after the couple's suicide, their remains were recovered.

"Today, their bodies were found. They were discovered in different locations. We were fortunate that they didn't go out to sea," an official from the Minbya Social Affairs group told Narinjara News.

Ma Yi Yi San, 23, is the daughter of U Kyaw Oo Tha of Ying Ye Kan Village, Pauktaw Township, while Ma Khin Moe Than (Tom Boy), 22, is the daughter of U Nga Me Lone of Ukkapyan Ward, Minbya Township.

A combined search by ULA/AA Law Enforcement and Public Security (DLEPS) troops and village elders led to the discovery of the two bodies on August 14.

Ma Khin Moe Than's body was discovered at 9:30 am on the riverbanks of the Kyar Pike Kay village, while May Yi Yi San's body was discovered at noon on the river banks of the Thinganet village, an LGBT local in Minbya said.

"Their families' refusal to accept them as transgender was the primary cause of their death. I believe it was also due to criticism from their friends and the community around them. We in Rakhine society really need to be a community to accept LGBT (transgender) people. Whether girls are in love with each other or boys are in love with each other, they should not be criticized or offended, and the communities should accept them as they are," he said.

According to LGBTQ campaigners, the number of LGBTQ suicides in Myanmar is increasing year over year because society and families frequently deny the existence of LGBTQ individuals.

It is also discovered that in Myanmar, prejudice based on sexual orientation is still permitted by law, and that under Section 377 of the Penal Code, people are still being prosecuted.
