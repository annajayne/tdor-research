We are heartbroken by the passing of Jholerina ‘Madam J’ Timbo, a powerful Namibian activist, movement builder, and the founding director of Wings to Transcend Namibia, one of Pan Africa ILGA’s member organisations.

Jholerina was a trailblazer in the fight for the rights and dignity of trans people in Namibia, and her leadership, courage, and unwavering belief in a more just world have left an indelible mark on the trans movement.

She stood tall in spaces that were never made for her, and she made space for others. We honour her life, her labour, and her love.

Rest in power, Jholerina.

Portrait in progress of Pontianna Ivan, 1997 - 2025.

Pontianna, I remember you dancing and spinning with your kind, bubbly smile. With bold eyeliner, glossy lips, and an afro; or maybe twists, braids, or a long bouncy wave. I remember your voice. The lilt of it, the way you spoke as if you were recalling a poem. I remember the way you could do it all. The models you coached and photoshoots you designed through your entertainment company. The unmatched charisma you had with a microphone in your hand. The face masks you made at the beginning of the pandemic. Your knack for whispering with nature and the parenting philosophy you practiced with your cats. The wisdom you channelled. The oils you made with herbs and flowers. The holy water. How introspective you were about the world and your purpose in it. How so much of your purpose was to foster hope and to encourage everyone to embrace exactly who they are.

I remember when you told me about the nights you survived alone on the streets of DC, Atlanta, and LA. How your legs ached and swelled from not having anywhere to sit without being harassed, let alone to sleep. How you hustled hard so you could have enough money to stave off an angry stomach. How you looked out for others who had to do the same. How, at the end of the day, you were priced out of health care that could have helped your heart, a heart that had given the world so much in a short 28 years. 

How did you come from Zambia to the United States so young and become the beautiful you in a society that is so ignorant and hateful towards Black trans women, towards immigrants, towards people in crisis? How did you hold on to that beauty inside you? Why did you have to go so soon? All I know is that you are the dancer, the diviner, the beloved, THE ENTERTAINER, Pontianna Ivan, and now you are forever an angel!

I’m up late wanting everyone to know their names: Pontianna Ivan. Louraca Jackson. Nona Conner.

three Black trans women who were on the DecrimNow DC campaign have died in 4 years. we love you, we’ll avenge you.




I still have little info on Pontiànna Ivan's death. She was 28 yo, a black trans woman, entertainer from Zambia, living in the USA. While reverse-searching her name, she appears on a friend's tribute :

She likely was featured on a video and interview on black trans sex workers and their fights. Not sure though.
