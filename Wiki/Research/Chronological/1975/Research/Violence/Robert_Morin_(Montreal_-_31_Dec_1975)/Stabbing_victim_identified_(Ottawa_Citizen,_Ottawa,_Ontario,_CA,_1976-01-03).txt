===== Stabbing victim identified =====

MONTREAL (CP) — Robert Morin, 22, was identified Friday by police as the second victim in a New Year's Eve stabbing.

Police found the bodies of Morin and Claude Jean, 22, described as female impersonators, in an east-end apartment.

A neighbor called police after receiving a telephone call from one of the men asking him to call police.

The deaths bring the final number of homicides recorded in 1975 by Montreal Urban Community police to 104, believed to be a record for any Canadian city.
