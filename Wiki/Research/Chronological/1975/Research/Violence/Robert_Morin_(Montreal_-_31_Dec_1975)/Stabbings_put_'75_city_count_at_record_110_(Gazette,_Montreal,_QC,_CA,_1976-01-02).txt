===== Stabbings put '75 city count at record 110 =====

Two female impersonators were stabbed to death New Year's Eve, raising Montreal's murder toll for 1975 to a record 110.

In 1974 police investigated 66 murders.

With only an hour left before the New Year, police were called to an apartment at 7595 Viau Blvd. in St. Leonard where they found the bodies of Claude Jean, 23, and another unidentified male.

Police said one of the victims telephoned a neighbor, asking for help.

Both men were dead when police arrived. The victims were employed in nightclubs as female impersonators who stripped on stage.
