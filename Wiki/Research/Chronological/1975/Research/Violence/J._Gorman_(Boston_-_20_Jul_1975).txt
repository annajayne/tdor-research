> Transvestite Murdered
> By David Brill
> BOSTON Dick Miller left his apartment on Melrose Street in Boston's Bay Village at about 5:30 last Sunday morning to buy the Sunday newspaper, and when he returned, he found the body of a brown-haired, hazel-eyed transvestite on his doorstep, bleeding profusely from the head. Boston police have identified the person as 23-year-old James L. Gorman, whose place of residence was listed as the Milner Hotel in Boston. It was the 65th murder in Boston this year.
> 
> Police said that Gorman, who was a regular patron at Jacques lounge, had been shot once in the head at close range, and died instantly of lacerations of the skull and brain. It has also been learned that a one-dollar bill was tucked under his body. Homicide Sgt. John Daley stated that the police have a description of the car from which they believe the victim was thrown prior to the shooting.
> 
> Gorman was seen less than one hour earlier in front of the Greyhound bus terminal on St. James Avenue, accord- ing to police sources. He usually carried a pocketbook with him, but was found without it on the Bay Village sidewalk.
> 
> Anyone having knowledge of Gor- man's whereabouts that evening or morning, or other information that could be of assistance in investigating the matter, is asked to contact Sgt. Daley at the Boston Police Depart- ment's Homicide Bureau, 247-4470.
