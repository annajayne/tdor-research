PORTERVILLE (UPI) — Manuel Carrasco Jr., 20, of Porterville was charged today with murder in the beating death of a man whose body clothed in womens evening dress was found near Lake Success.

Tulare County Sheriffs deputies said Carrascos arrest Monday came after several tips by informants.

They said Carrasco was charged with beating Kenneth E. Callaway, 64, of Camp Nelson with a shovel in the parking lot at Vista Point near the lake Dec. 5.

The body, dressed in a womans evening gown and cape, was discovered by two campers during the early morning hours.

Deputies said investigation showed that Carrasco picked up Callaway as the victim was hitchhiking near Porterville and apparently drove him to Vista Point where they got into an argument.

Deputies said they recovered the murder weapon.
