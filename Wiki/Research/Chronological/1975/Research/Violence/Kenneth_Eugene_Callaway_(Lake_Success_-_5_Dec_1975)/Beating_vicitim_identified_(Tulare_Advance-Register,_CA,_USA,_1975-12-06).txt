===== Beating victim identified =====

The body of a brutally beaten man discovered near Lake Success Friday morning has been identified as Kenneth Eugene Gallaway, 64, Camp Nelson.

A Tulare County sheriffs spokesman said today, however, that there are still no leads as to who killed the man, who was found dressed in womens clothing.

The victim, found lying near the south wall of Vista Point early Friday morning, was dressed in a long black evening gown and wearing a womans blonde wig, according to Tulare County Sheriffs investigators.

He was also wearing nylons, silver slippers, eye shadow and lipstick. A black and white checkered cape, two bracelets and earrings were found nearby. Police suspect the items were torn from the victims body.

A blood stained shovel also was found near the body, but officers have not officially identified it as the murder weapon.

Authorities said the man apparently had been bludgeoned to death about the head.
