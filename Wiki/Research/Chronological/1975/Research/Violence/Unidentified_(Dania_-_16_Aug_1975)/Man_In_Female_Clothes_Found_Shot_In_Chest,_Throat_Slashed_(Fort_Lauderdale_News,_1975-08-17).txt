===== Man In Female Clothes Found Shot In Chest, Throat Slashed =====

The body of an unidentified black male was found in a heavily wooded section of Dania, shot in the chest and his throat slashed from ear to ear, according to the Broward Sheriff's Office.

Police said the man was a transvestite.

The body, dressed in female clothing and partially hidden in weeds, was spotted yesterday morning about 50 feet from Bryan Road by a man taking a short cut through the woods.

A doctor's report placed the time of death between 11 p.m. Friday and 3 a.m. Saturday, Sgt. Gilles Sharette of the Sheriff's office said.

Sharette said the 5-foot, 3-inch, 148-pound victim was wearing a dress, high heels, white silk stockings, a padded bra, pink female underwear and white male underwear. Some of his hair had been dyed red.

Sharette said it is unlikely the murder occurred where the body was found. "There wasn't much blood at the site," he said. "Apparently the murder occurred somewhere else and the body was dumped there.

"Perhaps the victim was picked up by another male who thought he was picking up a female and killed him after learning the truth," Sharette said.
