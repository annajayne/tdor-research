Clifford (Tony) Butler, 33, proprietor of the after-hours drinking spot and also a female Impersonator at the club, refused to surrender his money, police reported. Butler and an unidentified man were killed in the shooting that followed. Police said the three intruders wore black nationalist uniforms of Levis, black berets and green shirts.
