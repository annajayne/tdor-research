Early on Saturday, 26 Jul, 1969, an armed gang of about 20 men dressed in the uniforms of Black Nationalists (Levis, green shirts, and black berets) surrounded the house where an after-hours speakeasy owned by Clifford (Tony) Butler, 38, was in operation. They entered the house, forced the 40 people present to stand against the wall and then demanded money.

Butler refused and was shot and killed along with an unnamed man. Three other people were injured.

Butler was identified as a female impersonator who was known to keep up to $3,000 on their person.
