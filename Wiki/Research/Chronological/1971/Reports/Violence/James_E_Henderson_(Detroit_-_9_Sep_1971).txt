James Henderson, 25, was shot and killed by Raymond Peterson, a member of the Detriot "S.T.R.E.S.S." (“Stop the Robberies and Enjoy Safe Streets.") police unit on Sep. 9, 1971.

The police report on the killing was badly inconsistent with both eyewitness reports and the coroner's autopsy.

The police report claimed that Henderson mugged a S.T.R.E.S.S. officer with a knife on the steps of a transient hotel and then ran inside when someone inside shouted "police!". They persued Henderson into the hotel, and through a hallway. They fired one shot at Henderson through a door, killing them.

The autopsy stated that Henderson had been shot in the chest, and that there were several abrasions around their right eye and on their lower back.

Eyewitnesses in the hotel told newsmen that two men dragged a struggling Henderson up the stairs of the hotel, and then forced them into the back of the hallway where they severely beat them and then shot them. 

Reports surfaced in April 1972 that police had told Henderson that "We're going to get you" after they witnessed another shooting, by the same police officers, of Herbert Childless on May 11, 1971.

In a trial in 1974, Raymond Peterson admitted planting a knife on the body of Robert Hoyt, 24, when Peterson shot and killed Hoyt after an off-duty traffic mishap. Peterson was responsible for 5 out of 9 deaths of civilians by the Detroit S.T.R.E.S.S squad during his time on the unit.
