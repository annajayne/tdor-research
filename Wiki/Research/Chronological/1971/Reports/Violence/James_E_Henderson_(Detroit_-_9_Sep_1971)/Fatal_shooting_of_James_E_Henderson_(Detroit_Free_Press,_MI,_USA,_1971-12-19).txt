**SEPT. 9,** the fatal shooting of James E. Henderson at 3113 Woodward. 

"James Brown was the point man that night — Jimmie and I are real close friends — and Ziolkowski and Worley were the cover.

"Jimmie made a pass In front of the shabby hotel at Woodward and Charlotte, then for some reason turned and started back up Woodward. I was walking closely behind him, which is something I don't ordinarily do.

"He was stopped near the sidewalk entrance to the hotel by someone who looked like a girl. I walked a door or two away and watched out of the corner of my eye.

"Suddenly he disappeared In the recess. I immediately walked back because, as I said, our cardinal rule Is never to go into buildings.

"Jimmie hadn't forgotten. He wasn't off the street, he was Just up the steps, completely exposed to our partners across the street.

"But as he started to walk down the steps, he was grabbed around the neck. The guy put a knife at his throat.

"I'm coming up the steps at the time, kind of sliding up the steps so he wouldn't see me until I got right on top of him.

"Another fellow's coming back from a hallway Inside the hotel. I don't know which of them spotted me first, but somebody said, 'Policel'"

**With that, Peterson said, the assailant released Brown and began a mad dash through a labyrinthine hallway, pursued by the two officers, who fired several shots at him**.

The man finally ducked into a room at the end of the hall. "Someone Inside the room shouted, 'Get out of here. I've got a shotgun.

"We fired one shot through the door, then rushed It. Our man was lying inside. It was my first shot that had hit him.

"I don't know if it was fate or what, but he turned out to be the same female impersonator who accosted me before, in the Childress case."
