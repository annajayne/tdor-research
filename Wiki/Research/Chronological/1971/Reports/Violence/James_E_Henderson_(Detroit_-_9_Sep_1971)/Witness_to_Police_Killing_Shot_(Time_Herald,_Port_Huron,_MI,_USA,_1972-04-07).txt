Ravitz also said one STRESS officer has been involved in eight of the 15 fatal shootings. Two other officers have each been involved in four deaths, he said.

Ravitz said one victim James Henderson, killed Sept. 9, 1971 was a witness to the shooting by STRESS officers of Herbert Childless on May II, 1971.

Henderson, Ravitz said, was told by police that "We're going to get you,' " after he witnessed the Childless shooting. Ravitz, however, refused to say how he heard about the alleged threat.
