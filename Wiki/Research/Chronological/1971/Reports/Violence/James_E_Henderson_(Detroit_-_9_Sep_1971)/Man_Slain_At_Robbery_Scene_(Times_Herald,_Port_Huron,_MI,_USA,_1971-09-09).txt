Man Slain At Robbery Scene

DETROIT (AP) — One of two men who attempted to hold up a plainclothes Detroit policeman early today was shot to death as he tried to flee from the robbery scene.

Police identified the deadman as James Henderson, 25, of Detroit and said his alleged accomplice, Raleigh McDuffy, was taken into custody.

Police said the patrolman assigned to the STRESS unit — a plainclothes group which seeks to draw out would-be holdup men in the downtown area — was on his beat when Henderson approached him.

The two men walked to a nearby house where Henderson then pulled a knife as the second holdup man joined them. At that point, the policeman's partner also entered the scene, identified himself as a police officer and told the two men to surrender. They made a break for freedom and Henderson was shot in the head.

Identities of the two policemen were not released pending departmental investigation.
