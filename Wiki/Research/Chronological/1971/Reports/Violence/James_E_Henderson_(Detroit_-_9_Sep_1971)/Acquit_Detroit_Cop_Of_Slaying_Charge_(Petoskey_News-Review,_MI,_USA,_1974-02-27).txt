===== Acquit Detroit Cop Of Slaying Charge =====

DETROIT (UPI) — Raymond Peterson, a member of the defunct undercover police STRESS unit who has been involved in the deaths of nine persons, was acquitted Tuesday on second-degree murder charges by a Detroit Recorder's Court Jury.

Peterson admitted in testimony last week in the courtroom of Judge Joseph Maher he planted his own knife on the body of Robert Hoyt after the 24-year-old Detroiter was shot to death following a traffic mishap with off-duty Peterson March 9.


Peterson, who was charged in Hyot's death, has been suspended from the Detroit Police Department since the incident.

Police said Peterson, who worked with the special decoy unit, (Stop The Roberies, Enjoy Safe Streets), was responsible for the deaths of five of the nine civilians while he was on duty as the died from bullets from his gun. STRESS was recently abolished by Mayor Colman Young. No charges were brought against Peterson in any of the previous deaths.

Wayne County Prosecutor said he couldn't understand Peterson's acquittal.

Peterson's defense attorney, Norman L. Lippitt, argued that police officers "tend to become paranoid about the citizenery," and are in constant fear of their lives.

"He (Raymond Peterson) was given a gun by ignorant bureaucrats and when he used it with fatal result, he was lauded and praised by narrow-minded non-thinking superiors," Lippitt said in his closing defense argument.

Peterson has received 27 citations and 14 recommendations for meritorious service as an officer with STRESS.

Assistant Waye County Prosecutor Fred Doestch told teh jury he had proved Peterson shot and killed Hoyt in March without provocation and the the witnesses he presented corroborated the charge.

Doetch cited testimony by two psychiatrists who said Peterson did not suffer from mental illness.

"Yes the defense says we are to believe he was suffering from paranoia," Doestch said.
