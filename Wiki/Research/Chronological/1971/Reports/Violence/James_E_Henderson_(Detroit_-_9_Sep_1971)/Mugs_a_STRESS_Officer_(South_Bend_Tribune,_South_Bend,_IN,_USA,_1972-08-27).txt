===== Mugs a STRESS Officer =====

Case number two:

 James Henderson was a 23-year-oId black transvestite who was killed on the night of Sept 9. The police reported he mugged a STRESS officer with a knife on the steps of a shabby transient hotel downtown and then ran into the hotel after someone inside shouted "police!"

STRESS officers said they pursued him into the hotels hallway, firing their guns at him as they ran.

The autopsy disclosed that Henderson had succumbed to a bullet wound in the chest. The examining physician also noted several abrasions around Hendersons right eye and on his lower back.

Witnesses in the hotel at the time of the shooting told newsmen they observed two men drag a struggling Henderson up the stairs of the hotel, force him into the back of the hallway where they severely beat him before shooting him.

As STRESS patrolman Raymond Peterson, 38, put it, "I dont know if it was fate or what, but he turned out to be the same female impersonator who accosted me before in the Childress case."

==== Accomplice in a Killing ====

Henderson allegedly was an accomplice in a knife wielding attack on Peterson by two others in a nearby hotel on May 11, and witnessed the killing of Herbert Childress, one of the assailants. Although arrested a block away, Henderson was never charged with a crime.
