===== Police Probe 3 Weekend Slayings =====

==== By GENE STEPHENS ====

Atlanta police were probing three mysterious weekend slayings Sunday, including that of a man dumped from a car on a downtown expressway exit ramp.

In addition, a man was found shot to death in an abandoned nursing home and another victim was bound, gagged and beaten to death.

No arrests had been made late Sunday. One victim might have been the latest in a string of murders, all committed by the same person.

Two other weekend deaths were also attributed to violence. Arrests were made and murder charges lodged in those cases.

The weekend killins brought to 205 the number of persons murdered in Atlanta so far this year.

A 30-year old Indiana man, Frank Monroe Shideler was dumped out of a maroom late-model Olsdmobile on the southbound 10th Street exit ramp of the North Expressway at 3:15 a.m. Saturday, police said.

A following car discovered the body and when police arrived they said they found the viction — in women's clothes complete with makeup, wig, and purse — lying face up in the middle of the ramp.

The victim had multiple gunshot wounds in the left side of the neck. Police identified him from items found in the purse and said they felt the man had been in Atlanta seeking work as a female impersonator.

The bullet-riddled body of Leonard Andrew Towe, 50, identified by police as a "transient," was found Saturday night in a room on the second floor of the abandoned Jewish Home at 260 14th St. NW.

Police said the victim had been shot five times — in the face, chest and both hands. They said he was lying face up on a mattress which was surrounded by spent cartidge shells.

Homicide Detective M. E. Horton said he suspects there is a tie-in between the death of Towe and several other recent killings.

He referred specifically to Leonard S. Hudson, 58, whos body was found Oct. 1 in a vacant house, and T. S. Moore, 46, who was found Oct. 10. Both were described as derelicts, the detective said.

"I think someone is going around killing winos," Horton said.

The body of Joseph Phels, 65, was found in his 15 Hilliard St. NE, apartment, Friday night. Police said Phelps was bound and gagged and lying on the floor in the front room. They said he had apparently been beaten to death. The room had been ransacked.
