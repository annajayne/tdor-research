On the evening of Dec. 6, 1971, Hazel Savage, 47, a cisgender woman, was brutally beaten to death by longtime acquaintance, James King, 46, in his apartment at 71 Tyler St., Paterson, New Jersey.

While drunk, and apparently delusional, King became convinced Savage was actually a transvestite and when she became romantic, he beat her to death with a wooden board and a hammer, in what he would claim was "self-defense."

King called the police at 11:25 p.m: The police said that King "told them he had just beaten, and may have killed, a transvestite."

Her injuries were extreme, including a fractured skull, two fractured arms, a fractured leg, and internal injuries. She died in the hospital at 3 a.m.

King was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 12 to 14 years in prison. The judge ordered that he undergo psychiatric evaluation and possible treatment in prison.
