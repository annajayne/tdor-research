Paterson man gets 12-14 years

PATERSON — James King, convicted by a jury of second degree murder, was sentenced to 12 to 14 years in prison by Superior Court Judge Charles S. Joelson yesterday.

The judge, while sentencing the 46-year-old King, said there was a question whether the man was medically sane although adjudged legally so. He then ordered King to be mentally examined upon reaching state prison and, if necessary, be given psychiatric treatment.

King, convicted by a jury on May 4, was charged with beating Miss Hazel Savage, 49. They lived together at 71 Tyler St., Paterson. The murder, described as brutal by the judge when imposing sentence, occurred on Dec. 6 in the their apartment.

During the trial the state alleged King had been drinking and when Miss Savage became amorous, an argument developed and she was beaten with a length of wood. King claimed temporary insanity because of drinking. He claimed he was being molested by a man and sought to defend himself.

Before sentencing, King protested his innocence again claiming he struck a man and Miss Savage was unharmed when he left the apartment. Judge Joelson noted King had a severe drinking problem.
