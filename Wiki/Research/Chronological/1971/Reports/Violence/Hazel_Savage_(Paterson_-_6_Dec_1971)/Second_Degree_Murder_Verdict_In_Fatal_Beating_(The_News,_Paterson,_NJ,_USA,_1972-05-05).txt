===== Second Degree Murder Verdict In Fatal Beating =====

A Passaic County Jury on Thursday convicted a Peterson man ol second degree murder for the fatal beating of a wom an he had associated with over several years.

James King, 46, of 71 Tyler St. did not deny striking the fatal blow. He did contend, however, that the person he had hit was a man dressed in women's clothes. Miss Hazel Savage, 47. who resided on Governor Street, had been visiting King at the time of the incident.

Police testified that King reported the homicide, but also stated that he told them he had just beaten, and may have killed, a transvestite. Miss Savage's nude body was found in King's apartment. It was also brought out that when King and the policemen entered the apartment. King pointed at the woman and commented that she was the woman he had beaten.

The defense produced two psychiatrists who testified yhat King was insane at the time of the killing. They agreed that he was suffering from an alcoholic delusion. King had contended that his friend, Hazel, brought the man dressed as a woman to his apartment.

Assistant Prosecutor David Simon argued that King was not the victim of toxic psychosis, but that he had been drinking and killed the woman in a fit of rage. The fatal beating occurred last Dec. 6.

The jury which presided over the two-week trial deliberated five hours Thursday and returned its second degree verdict to Superior Court Judge Charles S. Joelson. Simon was assisted in the trial by Detective Lt. Thomas R. Edmond, who investigated the case for the prosecutor's office.
