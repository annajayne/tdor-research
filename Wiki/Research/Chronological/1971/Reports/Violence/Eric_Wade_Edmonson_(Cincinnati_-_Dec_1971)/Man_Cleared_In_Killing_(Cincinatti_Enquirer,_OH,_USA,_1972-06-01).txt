Man Cleared In Killing

Common Pleas Court Judge Robert V. Wood dismissed a first degree manslaughter charge Wednesday against a man accused of killing a female impersonator last December.

The dismissal was announced at the close of the prosecutor's case against William Sonny Dews, 30, 1334 Linn St., who was charged with killing Eric Wayde Edmonson, 28, 748 Ridgeway Ave.

Dews had been in the Hamilton County Jail in lieu of $2000 bond since December 3, when Edmonson's body, dressed in woman's clothes, was found with a bullet in the head In the 500 block of Poplar Street.

Attorneys Ralph Crisci and Robert Schwartz, who represented Dews, said the only evidence linking Dews to the crime was a confession he gave police after six hours of questioning.

Crisci told Judge Wood that Dews was a chronic alcoholic who has a condition similar to epilepsy and had a fit shortly before the, interrogation began. "He said he would have confessed to killing Lincoln after six hours of questioning," Crisci said.
