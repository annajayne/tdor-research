===== Roommate Questioned In Knifing =====

A man's body was found severely cut and stabbed in his West Side apartment early Tuesday. His roommate is being held for investigation of homicide, police reported.

The body of Raymond H. Brown. Jr., 33, of 22 S. Western Ave., was found in the blood-spattered bathroom, according to Det. Sgt. J. C. Peake.

Patty Logan, a neighbor, told police she heard loud screams about midnight Tuesday, and looked out in time to see Brown's roommate, Larry Keith Romine, 19, run up the street wiping himself with a blood-soaked shirt, investigating officers reported.

ROMINE WAS arrested about 1 a.m. Tuesday after his name was made known to homicide investigators, Peake said.

Earlier, Romalne had called police from 25 Edison St., and had reported that he had been beaten up by a group of people in the street. Police transported him to Granview hospital for treatment, Peake said.

Romine told officers three different versions of having been jumped by the group, and because of the discrepancies, they did not file a formal complaint, according to a patrol section commander.

He was treated for minor cuts and bruises, according to the officers who responded to the Edison St. call.

Peake said indications are that both men participated in the fight, in which two butcher knives and a table knife were used.
