===== Indictment Returned Against Stab Suspect =====

The Montgomery county grand jury yesterday returned a first degree manslaughter indictment against Larry Keith Romine who allegedly stabbed a man to death in a bloody knife fight July 24.

Dayton police identified both Romine and the deceased, Raymond H. Brown Jr., 33, as female Impersonators.

The two began an argument at Brown's apartment, 22 South Western avenue, West Dayton, which later developed into a knife duel. Romine, 19, of 17 Paisley street, West Dayton, also faces a burglary charge.
