===== Police Probe Fatal Knifing =====

Police last night were investigating the fatal stabbing of an unidentified victim at 22 South Western avenue.

Police said the victim was found in the bathroom of the home and had sustained multiple knife wounds.

Authorities said the victim was a female impersonator, apparently picked somebody up at either a bar or a corner and returned to the Western avenue home located behind a vacant store.
