Man Partly Clad In Feminine Garb Is Murder Victim

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)—The body of a 24-year-old Columbus man, partially clad in feminine apparel, was found tied with wires or rope in his apartment here Thursday night.

Police identified him as Robert Eugene Montgomery, who lived with his brother William.

Officers said there was no sign, of violence. Burglary was ruled out when the dead man's billfold was found with $57 in it.

Radio and electrical equipment was strewn on the floor about the bed. Dr. Robert A. Evans, Frank lin County coroner, said the equipment may have played a part in Montgomery's death.
