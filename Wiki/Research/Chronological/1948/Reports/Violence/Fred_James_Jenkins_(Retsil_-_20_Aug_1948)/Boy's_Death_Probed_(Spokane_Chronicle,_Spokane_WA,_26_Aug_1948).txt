PORT ORCHARD, Wash., Aug 26, (UP) - Detectives today began an intensive investigation into the death of Fred James Jenkins, 14, whose body was found hanging from a rafter in his Retsil, Wash., home Friday night.

A coroner's jury declared here yesterday that his death was caused by "a person or persons unknown." It first believed the death was accidental or suicide.
