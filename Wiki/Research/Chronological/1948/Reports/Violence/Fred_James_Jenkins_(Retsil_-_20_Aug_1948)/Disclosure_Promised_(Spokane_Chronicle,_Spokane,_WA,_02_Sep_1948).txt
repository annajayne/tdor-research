===== Disclosure Promised =====
BREMERTON, Sept. 2. (AP)—Sheriff Pete Henderson said last night he will have a "startling" disclosure in a couple of days in connection with the death of 14 year-o1d Fred James Jenkins, who was found clad in women's clothes and hanged in the family home at Retsil August 21.

He declined to comment on a report that a note which was found in the suit the boy was wearing is missing. Officers said the note carried the terse message: "Tell me tonight."

Prosecuting Attorney James Munro discounted foul play tn the death, but Coroner Al H. Segerouist insisted a coroner's jury verdict on foul play was correct.
