On the night of 21 Aug, 1948, the body of 14 year-old Fred James Jenkinks was found, dressed in their mother's clothing and with a scarf wrapped around their neck, hanged from a closet rafter in their parents home in Retsil, Washingon.

Investigation over the next few days resulted in a coronor's report, on 25 Aug, that the death had been caused by "a person or persons unknown." This conclusion was disputed by the police prosecutor's office, who believed it was a suicide. 

An unnamed man was taken into custody and questioned around 27 Aug regarding the death, but apparently released without charges.

A note found on the body of the youth reading only "Tell me tonight", was reported by the police on 1 Sept as having disappeared from police custody without explanation. Their family was also reported to have moved to Kitsap country because of fears for their safety around that time.
