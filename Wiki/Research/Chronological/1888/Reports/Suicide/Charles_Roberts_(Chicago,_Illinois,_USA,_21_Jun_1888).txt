On 7 July 1888 the body of Charles Roberts, a Swiss sailor who had come to Chicago from Pittsburg around the first week of June 1888, was discovered floating about two miles offshore clothed in a woman's dress and with a forty-pound stone tied to their ankles by a rope. The discovery of the unidentified body inspired much speculation about the possibility of a murder, but was revealed a few days later to have been a suicide by the discovery of a suicide note by Charles Roberts written around the fourth week of June that could be linked to the body and the circumstances of its discovery.
