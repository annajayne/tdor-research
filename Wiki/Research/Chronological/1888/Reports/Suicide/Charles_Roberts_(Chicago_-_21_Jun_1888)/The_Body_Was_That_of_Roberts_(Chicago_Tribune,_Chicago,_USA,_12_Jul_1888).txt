===== THE BODY WAS THAT OF ROBERTS. =====

==== A Reporter Discovers the Identity of the Supposed Murdered Man. ====
The body of a man was found by the life-saving crew last Sunday two miles out in the lake. It was attired in a woman's wrapper. There was a forty-pound stone attached to the feet, and it gave rise to the belief that the man had been murdered. The police could go no further. The man has been identified and will be buried today. Five weeks ago Charles Roberts, a Swiss sailor about 30 years old, came to Chicago from Pittsburg. He got employment in a South WWater street butter house as porter. He remained there three days. He met Fredrick Fortin, a mechanic in the employ of the LInk Belt Manufacturing Company on Jefferson street near Washington. Fortin is also a coal-dealer and boarding-house keeper at 127 North Center avenue. Roberts took up his quarters with the Fortin. Monday three weeks ago he told Mrs. Fortin that she need not be surprised if he did not return for dinner or supper, as he thought of going on a journey. The following evening an officer of the Larrabee Street Station visited Mr. Fortin and asked him if he knew Roberts.

"I do," was the reply.

"Then you are wanted at the station."

Arriving there he was informed that a small rowboat had been found a couple of miles out in the lake and the following note was in it:

"To any person who may find my clothes, deliver them to my friend, Fred Fortin of No 127 North Centre avenue. I am tired of life and wish to die."

Fortin recognized the clothing, watch, and handwriting as belonging to Roberts.

Another note written in English, which served as the clew to identify the man in the woman's wrapper as Charles Roberts, was as followes:

"Please giv dese man a Mother Hubart dress."

The police took the clothes and awaited developments. No body was found for three weeks, and they sent the clothes to the Coroner, where they now are, notes and all, and where they were seen by a reporter. The similarity of writing in the note that called for the "Mother Hubbard" and the one addressed to Fortin led the reporter to believe that the body in the dress was that of Roberts. He got Mr. Fortin to go to the morgue yesterday, and as soon as he stepped among the dead bodies lying on the slabs he said with a shudder as he pointed to the man wearing the woman's wrapper: "That's Roberts. I identify him by his gaiter shoes and the red coton socks."

From Mr. Fortin it was learned that Roberts had neither kith nor kin in either the old country or America.
