===== ANOTHER LAKE MYSTERY. =====

==== The Body Proves to Be That of a Man—Who Was He and How Came He There? ====

=== FINDING THE BODY. ===

The body of a man in the clothes of a woman with a stone weight forty pounds tied to his legs was found floating in the lake two miles from shore yesterday afternoon.

Who is the man?
How did he come there?
What was a woman's dress his shroud?

The three questions must be answered to solve the most peculiar, most horrible mystery that has ever asisen in Chigago. Not in the annals of the police nor the realms of romance is to be found a similar case. Of of two things is sure: It was either a diabolical murder or an inexplicable suicide. The theory which was most freely advanced last night, was that the man was a sailor and murdered by his mates, who threw him overboard after tying a stone to his feet. This is the theory of Captain St. Peter, of the Life Saving Station, who towed the body to shore. If it was a murder there was a motive for it, and many are suggested. One is that the man hired out as a cook, wearing feminine apparel and pretending to be a woman; that the sailors discovered the deception and were so enraged over it that

== THEY KILLED HIM FOR IT. ==

Another cause assigned is mutiny, but few incline to this belief. Others hint that the man was guilty perhaps of a crime so intolerant and base that his mates deemed him no longer fit to live. As long as men live unkind things will be said of dead men, and this is a case where many place the victim in the depths of degradation. Some believe he was not a sailor or murdered by saolors, but was taken in a rowboat from the shore, clad in a woman's garments as a sign of unmanliness and deliberately drowned. Still another theory, which will be held by many, is that the man was a sailore and murdered by his mates for his money. But why should they put him in a woman's dress?

The theory of suicide is seemingly opposed to the circumstances. The man might have been crazy, and to prevent detection and the frustration of his plans, he disguised himself in feminine apparel, rowed two miles into the lake and then tied the stone to his legs. When found, however, the knots of the rope were at the back of the ankles, in a position impossible for a man to tie himself.

== THE FINDING OF THE BODY. ==
is almost as strange as the crime. The huge stone attached to the feet was evidently intended to forever rest on the bottom of Lake Michigan. How the body arose to the surface with the stone attached to it is a mystery for which several solutions are offered. The main one is that it was due to concussion of the water by the heavy storm yesterday morning, the lighting striking the water.

It was about 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon when Captain John Nolan, of the tug R. Prindiville, saw a cloth fluttering on the surface of the water. He thought at first a small sailboat had capsized and with full speed steered toward it. On approachhing closer he saw that it was a woman's dress. Having no means of raising the body from the water, Captain Nolan returned immediately to notify Captain St. Peter, of the Life Saving Station. Taking a crew of two men he pulled rapidly in the big surf boat to the corpse. It was a sickening sight, but the men quailed not. After numerous ineffectual efforts to raise the body into the boat that course was abandoned, and a line was made fast around the corpse, and then the boat was pulled slowly back to the station,

== TOWING THE CORPSE AFTER IT. ==

The police department was telephoned that the body of a woman had been found in the lake, and subsequently the Central patrol wagon was detailed to convey it to the Morgue.

The body, which, with all its discoloration and deformation, lies upon a slab of marble at the City Morgue, tells but a little of the tale of its mysterious death. A low, receding forehead, and a face which, in the dim light of the uncanny place, and with its changes wrought by water, seems darkhued and dusky, gives a first impression that the victim was a negro. But a casual examination dispels that thought. The hair is of medium length, and was evidently far from coarse, and certainly not woolly. The face, though bloated, was once that of a fine-featured man, and wore no beard or mustache. The cleanly shaven coutenance, and carefully tended finger nails, hardly indicate the maniac or the dissolute, and upon the feet are a pair of shoes which would only have been

== WORN BY A MAN OF THRIFT. ==
They are of a good quality, sewwed and cut in style which indicates that their purchaser cared something for personal appearance, and was not too poor to buy good goods. The only article of distinctively masculine attire on the body is a linen shirt. This bears out the general idea of thrift to which the little indiccations point. It is of good quality, well made, evidently new, and strangely bears no mark, even of a laundry. Around the ankles is tied a piece of rope. The knot is of the ordinary slpnoose shape, and is behind the legs. It could hardly have been pulled then by the victim himself, and was drawn so tight that it is not probable it could habe been slipped there by the action of the water. There are no indications which point to suicide; there are no evidences of foul play. The possibility that it was a murder, and not a suicide, simply looks to the vague incidents, or accidents, perhaps of the meager attire, which seem to point to the fact that he was a man at least well dressed, and to the fact that is is hardly probably that the rope was tied by the victim himself.

== THE DRESS HE WORE ==
is a light seersucker wrapper, a foot and half too short for him, and one in which he could not have been when anyone could have seen him, without attracting more than passing attention. This dress, with its peculiar cut and patter, may prove a valuable clue in unraveling the mystery.
