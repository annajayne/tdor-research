===== That Mysterious Body. =====

The body of a man found two miles out in the lake, which was dressed in woman's clothes and had a stone tied to the feet, was not the body of James G. Jones. Jones is still alive and is now now the Washingtonian Home, where he was privately taken by friends several days ago. It is believed to be a case of suicide. The clothing was not the elaborate female apparel some of the reporters would lead one to imagine. The dress was in reality a cheap calico wrapper worn over a cotton nightshirt, and the shoes were heavy and cheap.
