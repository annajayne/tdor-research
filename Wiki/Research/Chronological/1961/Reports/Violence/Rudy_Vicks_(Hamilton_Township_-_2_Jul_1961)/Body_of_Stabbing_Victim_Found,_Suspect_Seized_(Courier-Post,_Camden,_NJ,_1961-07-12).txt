===== Body of Stabbing Victim Found, Suspect Seized =====

TRENTON (UPI)—The partially decomposed body of a laborer was found on a farm in nearby Hamilton Township Tuesday night and police charged another worker with fatally stabbing the victim.

The body was identified as that of Rudy Vicks, 33, an employe of the Westland Farm, owned by Neil West, on the Allentown-Crosswicks rd. George Simmons, 34, was charged with murder in the slaying.

Police reported that on the night of July 2 Simms and Vicks had an argument in Vicks' shack on the farm. During the fight, Simmons said, he stabbed Vicks several times with a kitchen knife.

Vicks ran from the shack and was not seen until the body was discovered dressed in women's clothing.
