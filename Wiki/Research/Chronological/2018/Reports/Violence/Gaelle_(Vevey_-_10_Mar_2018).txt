> On March 10, 2018, a 27-year-old woman from Valais was found dead in Lake Geneva after spending the night on the shores of the lake with four men, accused of abusing the vulnerable young trans woman. Their trial opens Tuesday.
> LeMatin.ch looks back at the death of Gaëlle, a 27-year-old woman from Valais, found drowned in Lake Geneva one morning in March 2018. On the eve of the trial of four men accused of raping her and abandoning her to her fate, journalist Evelyne Emeri gives her mother the floor. She says that Gaëlle had long been "weakened, pushed aside. She just wanted to be a normal woman with a normal life. She was getting through it. She was on the right path."
> 
> The mother recalls her eldest daughter's difficult youth, "the looks and judgments pushing some to change sidewalks", while she began her transition with the support of her family and the local LGBT community. Gaëlle had ended up leaving her village in Valais to settle down with her boyfriend on the Vaud Riviera. In recent times, her mother continues, the young woman had found a vocation as an artist in drawing and painting, taking care of animals. She was "resplendent".
> 
> Alcohol, medication and drugs
> Until the evening of March 9, 2018: an argument with her ex-boyfriend, and everything had "gone to hell". Toxicological analyses showed that Gaëlle had consumed a significant amount of alcohol and antidepressants when she met a group of asylum seekers in Vevey. Four men with whom she allegedly took other drugs by the lake, before a series of sexual abuses. Facts disputed by the defendants, who speak of consensual relations. In the early morning, two of the defendants saw Gaëlle in the lake, in water that was 7 degrees that morning. Instead of calling for help, they stole her phone.
> 
> The two Algerians, the Moroccan and the Tunisian, aged 26 to 32, will be charged with sexual acts committed against a person incapable of discernment or resistance, failure to provide assistance and violation of the federal law on narcotics.



> Vaud Gaëlle, abused and died in the lake in Vevey: her mother testifies
> The four applicants, accused of having all coerced the 27-year-old Valais woman and of having abandoned her in danger of death at the water's edge, will be tried on Tuesday. Courageously, her mother tells us about her daughter.

> “According to the media, my daughter was a prostitute. It’s unbearable. She was transgender, imprisoned in a man’s body. She was weakened, cast aside. She just wanted to be a normal woman with a normal life. She was getting out of it. She was on the right path. The AI ??had finally recognized her suffering and her reintegration after years of struggle. It had boosted her. She had also ended a tumultuous relationship with her boyfriend. She wanted to free herself from everything and take charge of her life.” K., the mother of the young woman found dead in the lake in Vevey on March 10, 2018, agreed to talk about Gaëlle, her eldest, to silence the insanities and meanness towards her.

> "People were changing sidewalks"
> 
> At birth, Gaëlle was called Michaël. Uncomfortable in her skin, uncomfortably in her head, uncomfortably in her being, the child, who became a teenager, ended up opening up fully to her parents, her younger brother and those close to her. "We listened to her and understood her. At every stage, we supported and accompanied her, the LGBT community too. During her transition period, at the time of her operation in March 2013 (editor's note: she is 22 years old) and afterwards, when the looks and judgments push some people to change sidewalks." As if she had the plague. "At the end of 2014, she had to leave the village where we live in Valais. It was too hard for her to stay there. Her difference was not accepted. She left to settle in the Riviera, a region where her boyfriend lived who also helped her a lot at that time."
> 
> "She had found her way"
> 
> “Gaëlle was an artist. She had a gift. Her passion was drawing and painting. Abstract art. She had trained for four years at the École professionnelle des Arts Contemporains in Valais. But she didn’t want to work in her profession. She didn’t feel like it. She wanted to get into tattoos. At the beginning of 2018, she volunteered with animals in the hills above Vevey. She was delighted. She had always been surrounded by pets at home. She grew up with them. She had found her way. Everything was starting to work out. She was taking flight. She was resplendent.”

> "She must have gone into a tailspin."

> So what happened on that fateful Friday, March 9, 2018, on the shores of the lake in Vevey (VD)? "A lot of things happened that famous Friday evening. They saw each other with her ex-boyfriend. They argued. Since I know her, I think she got all worked up. She must have lost it, I have no other explanation. She went off the rails. She didn't tell me everything. She was 27 years old... She wanted to meet someone who would support her, wanted to build a more peaceful relationship. What is certain is that Gaëlle didn't drink or smoke cannabis. She was taking Xanax (editor's note: an anxiolytic) and an antidepressant on prescription. She tried not to take them all the time. She was feeling so much better."
> 
> Arrests in several phases
> 
> The unfortunate woman was found the next day, Saturday, March 10, 2018, at around 7:20 a.m., by a walker. Her body was floating not far from the bank of Quai Ernest-Ansermet, near the Buvette des bains publics and the Rowing Club. Five days later, the cantonal police launched an appeal for witnesses to try to reconstruct Gaëlle's last moments, her last evening. The police arrested and imprisoned four asylum seekers from the Établissement vaudois d'accueil des migrants, in several phases. Three from the EVAM in Vevey and one from Leysin: two Algerians, a Moroccan and a Tunisian, aged 26 to 32. All will have to answer, mainly, for sexual acts committed against a person incapable of discernment or resistance, failure to provide assistance and violation of the federal law on narcotics.
> 
> Abused four times
> 
> Dated 7 November 2018, the indictment by prosecutor Stephan Johner is damning for the detained quartet. He states that on that Friday, around 7:10 p.m., two of the four applicants met Gaëlle in front of the EVAM centre in Vevey. She had a bottle of rum in her hand and was drinking from the bottle. They allegedly decided together to go to the lakeside near the Buvette des bains publics to smoke cannabis. This is where the first sexual abuse – disputed – took place, while the Valais woman's condition was clearly impaired by significant consumption of alcohol and medication (editor's note: anxiolytics in the therapeutic range/antidepressants in toxic values) , as revealed by toxicological analyses. She was probably also under the influence of cannabis, according to the Public Prosecutor's Office. The second migrant, in turn, maintained a full relationship with the young woman.
> 
> Abandoned in danger of death
> 
> After that, the alleged leader of this lamentable expedition – and the first abuser according to the prosecution – wanted more marijuana. He called two friends who brought him a joint, smoked by the protagonists and the victim. A third migrant, visibly encouraged by the leader of the group, also took advantage of and abused Gaëlle, who managed to slap him. Around 9 p.m., this same alleged leader contacted the fourth co-accused so that he would bring, this time, cocaine. And promised him that in exchange, he could assault and coerce his prey. After obtaining his favors, the quartet abandoned the young woman, alone in the immediate vicinity of the lake whose water was at 7 degrees, in complete physical and psychological distress, in danger of death. Two of the defendants returned about ten minutes later and saw her in the lake. Rather than calling for help, they stole his cell phone and left.
> 
> Comparable to a rotating
> 
> Despite their denials, three of the four suspects arrested were quickly caught by their seminal fluids and their DNA profiles, found in the private parts and under the fingernails of the unfortunate woman. They had no choice but to confess and confirm having had sexual relations with Gaëlle. They accuse their accomplice, who allegedly incited them to commit the act. Prosecutor Johner specifically held, against him alone and in addition to everything else, instigation to sexual acts committed on a person incapable of discernment or resistance. No trace of sperm or DNA from this migrant was found on the body of the deceased. The man barely admits to having kissed her and caressed her breasts. Given the circumstances comparable to a gang rape, it is highly likely that an aggravation of the offences will be requested at the opening of the hearing by the family's lawyer, Mr Astyanax Peca, for an attack on sexual integrity committed jointly.
> 
> "Our daughter is a real victim"
> 
> At the trial scheduled for three days, Gaëlle's parents and relatives will not be there. They have asked to be excused. "The confrontation with these four individuals, who defiled her, humiliated her and left her alone in her condition on the edge of the lake, is impossible for us. The first anniversary of her death has just passed. I left her room at home. At first, I went there a lot. Now, I no longer have the courage." What do they expect from justice? "That the law be well made. That our daughter be recognized as a real victim. That they (editor's note: the 4 co-accused, 3 of whom were illegal residents) serve their sentence and far away. They have no place here."
> 
> She couldn't have consented
> 
> The East Vaud District Criminal Court will sit in the cantonal courtroom in Renens on Tuesday from 9 a.m. The challenge of this trial will be to prove that Gaëlle was not able to give her consent and that she never gave it, contrary to what the co-defendants claim. While forensic medicine did not discover any injuries to her private parts, it did find dermabrasions on her remains, which could have been the result of her fall, her stay in the lake or human intervention ante mortem. But there is one thing that will remain forever unanswered, unless there is a twist during the hearing, and that is how the victim fell into the icy waters of Lake Geneva.
