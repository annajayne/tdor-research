> Mahsa, a 27-year-old trans woman who had reassignment surgery a few years ago, was murdered by her father, brother-in-law, and cousins in the desert near Shadegan in January 2019. According to the Shesh-Rang report, Shadegan police arrested Mahsa's father on counts of complicity in premeditated murder and arrested Mahsa's brother on murder charges. Because the matter concerned members of the same family, there was no one entitled to “blood money,” so Mahsa's father was simply released and did have to serve time in jail or settle any fees. 


> According to documents obtained by Shesh Rang a few months ago, Mahsa, a transgender woman who had successfully undergone gender reassignment surgery a few years ago, was murdered by her father, stepbrother, and cousins in the deserts around Shadegan in January 2018. Shesh Rang had refused to publish it 
> 
> According to information provided to Sheshrang by one of Mahsa's fellow citizens, Mahsa's father, stepbrother, and the men in her uncle's family were aware of the murder of Mahsa, who was called "Mustafa" before her gender reassignment, and participated in the murder in various ways.
> 
> The knife is the murder weapon used to kill Mahsa. Evidence suggests that Mahsa's brother was the main perpetrator. Both Mahsa's father and brother were arrested by the local police in Shadegan, the former for complicity in the murder and the latter for the commission of the murder.
> 
> Mahsa's father has been released from prison due to lack of a private complainant, and her son, who is still in prison for murder, is awaiting the court's decision on appeal. Mahsa's stepbrother also has no private complainant. According to information received by Sheshrang, Mahsa's stepmother also resisted the arrest of the two after Mahsa's murder, and after their arrest, despite her love and close relationship with Mahsa, she was forced to consent, which led to the release of the father of the murder accomplice from prison.
> 
> Mahsa had successfully undergone gender reassignment surgery four years ago, and after being officially recognized as a woman, she suffered from structural discrimination against women in addition to transphobia in society.
> 
> Mahsa had undoubtedly made many efforts and resistances to obtain a female gender identity, she had rejected the male privileges of this society and wanted to live herself and her dreams. Although she had to submit to the painful process of non-standard surgeries to achieve this wish, not only did she not achieve her wish to have the right to live with her desired identity, but the men in her family looked at her as someone who had taken away the honor of the “nation”. Mahsa had undergone the surgery in Tehran, hidden from the eyes of her relatives, with the idea that after undergoing gender reassignment surgery, she would be free from social pressure and insults, and only at the insistence of her adoptive mother did she return to Shadegan to visit her… a return that remained irreversible. The reality of Mahsa’s fate tells us that citizenship rights for trans people are not relevant in Iranian society even after undergoing gender reassignment surgery, and even these surgeries do not protect them from transphobic attacks that in many cases lead to the loss of their lives.
