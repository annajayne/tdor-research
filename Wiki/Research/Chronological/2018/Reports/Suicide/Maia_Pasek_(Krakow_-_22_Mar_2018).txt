> The Chronicle's reporting team that has continued digging into the Zizians, and reports on how rationalist ideas have pushed at least two people — who may or may not have been psychologically vulnerable to begin with — to have psychotic breaks or mental collapses. (Says one individual who chose to remain anonymous after being imprisoned for an assault that took place during one such mental break, "There’s inherent stress in concluding that humanity is heading toward an apocalypse that will kill everyone you care about.")
> 
> They've also now uncovered more about the story of a young trans woman from Poland, Maia Pasek, whose name had been mentioned in multiple rationalist forums as being a victim of Ziz and her teachings. Pasek took her own life in March 2018, jumping off a building in her native Krakow, about two months after coming out as transgender, and a year after traveling to the Bay Area to attend a rationalist conference put on by CFAR (the Center for Applied Rationality).
> 
> Pasek's girlfriend, who had moved with her to the Canary Islands in 2017 ostensibly to start their own rationalist movement, tells the Chronicle that her suicide was likely spurred by a confluence of factors, including her overall mental state. But LaSota had been in significant contact with Pasek, and had allegedly convinced her that her two brain hemispheres were split, one male and one female, and that her female half was suicidal due to her being trans.
> 
> Pasek, in one of her final writings in February 2018, wrote in a comment on [Ziz] LaSota's blog that suicide was the "obvious choice" for "bearers of selfish utility functions who expect negative utility."




> Maia Pasek wanted to save the world. Then she met ‘Ziz’

> 
> While seeking life’s greater purpose on a tropical island off Morocco, amid marathon meditation sessions and experiments with self-optimization, Maia Pasek discovered a new source of enlightenment halfway across the globe. 
> 
> It was “Ziz,” the Bay Area blogger now linked to six violent deaths from Vallejo to Vermont.
> 
> Like Pasek, Ziz — whose legal name is Jack LaSota — was a young transgender woman who had eschewed meat-eating and immersed herself in rationalism, a Berkeley-centered movement focused on thinking more effectively and protecting the human race from the prospect of runaway artificial intelligence.
> 
> By the time they started interacting in web forums, in 2017, Pasek and LaSota had each left conventional society to build their own small rationalist communities. Pasek lived in a communal apartment in the Canary Islands, Ziz in a rusting tugboat anchored near Half Moon Bay.
> 
> The Caleb, a partially submerged ship that was once home to “Ziz” LaSota, rests in Pillar Point Harbor near Half Moon Bay on Feb. 3. Law enforcement officials are investigating six deaths linked to associates of Ziz, the flagbearer of a small group of computer whizzes and devout vegans.

> 
> Noah Berger/For the S.F. Chronicle
> In her blog, Ziz steered rationalist ideas down dark and perplexing paths. While many readers found these musings disconcerting, Pasek was enthralled. “You say all the right things,” she wrote in a comment posted to LaSota’s blog, Sinceriously, on Dec. 3, 2017. “I cannot marry you right now, but let’s be best friends forever.”
> 
> The message gave way to a frenzy of online exchanges between Pasek and LaSota that some — including Ziz herself — would come to blame for what happened next. On March 22, 2018, while visiting her native Poland, Pasek took her own life, her ex-girlfriend said in an interview. She was 28.
> 
> Pasek’s death was part of a string of psychiatric crises that befell those in the rationalist community — and particularly in the orbit of the odd and magnetic Ziz — between 2017 and 2021, culminating in hospitalizations, at least two suicides and an attempted murder, the Chronicle found.
> 
> The incidents predate the six killings that catapulted LaSota and her cultlike clique of militant vegan computer whizzes into the spotlight this year, with seven associates now jailed on suspicion of offenses from trespassing to murder. The violence included the New Year’s Eve 2022 slaying of one associate’s parents, the stabbing of a Vallejo landlord and a traffic-stop shootout in Vermont that killed a Border Patrol agent.

> U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland is recognized with military honors before his burial at Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis on Feb. 22.

> Abbie Parr/Associated Press
> LaSota herself is imprisoned without bail in Maryland, accused of trespassing, obstruction and gun violations. In February, a resident reported to police that Ziz and two others — wearing all black and allegedly armed — had asked to camp on his remote property in two box trucks.
> 
> But it was the series of suicides and mental health crises that first alarmed some inside tight-knit rationalist circles. In blogs and online debates, they questioned whether there was something about “Zizian” ideas — or the apocalyptic fears broached in the broader rationalist movement — that could drive members to collapse.
> 
> Or, as others wondered, did the relationship go in the other direction? Was the intellectual community attracting people who were already psychologically vulnerable?
> 
> Jessica Taylor, an artificial intelligence researcher who worked from 2015 through 2017 at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, one of the most prominent rationalist organizations, said she experienced a psychotic break a few months after leaving.
> 
> “I don’t think that it is just that I have selected myself into a particularly mentally ill portion of the population, although that may be a part of it,” Taylor told the Chronicle. “I think also something strange is going on.”
> 
> Taylor, who wrote about her breakdown in a 14,000-word blog post in 2021 on the forum LessWrong, a hub for rationalist thought, said that some tenets and practices of rationalists could test the limits of a person’s sanity, sending them down existential wormholes. She described a “cult-like” sense of self-importance that coursed through MIRI.
> 
> “This was a set of people with a non-mainstream ideology that claimed that the future of the world depended on a small set of people that included many of them,” Taylor wrote.
> 
> In rationalist circles, pondering nightmarish scenarios involving AI was routine, with the concepts of good and evil providing frequent fodder for discussion. Adherents worried about “infohazards,” considered so dangerous that simply learning about them put a person at risk.
> 
> One example was a thought experiment, “Roko’s basilisk,” which posited that an omnipotent artificial intelligence would punish those who had been aware of its future capabilities but had failed to contribute to its existence. By this logic, those who even discussed Roko’s basilisk were effectively dooming their audience.
> 
> For Taylor, the topics manifested into a belief that she could inflict mass destruction with her “demonic powers.” She began to view herself as intrinsically evil. She said she became suicidal and checked into a psychiatric hospital.
> 
> “Is it a surprise,” she wrote, “that, after over a year in an environment where I was encouraged to think seriously about the possibility that simple actions such as writing blog posts … could destroy the world, I would develop the belief that I could destroy everything through subtle mental movements that manipulate people?”
> 
> Zack Davis, a 37-year-old Pleasant Hill rationalist, was hospitalized in 2013 and 2017 after two mental health-related incidents.
> 
> “We are not worried about AI chatbots that might say bad words,” the San Francisco State University math student said in an interview. “We are worried future AI systems might have God-like powers.”
> 
> During his most recent incident in February 2017, Davis sent a flurry of concerning emails and social media posts, pleading for help.
> 
> He wrote an email to an executive at CFAR (the Center for Applied Rationality), another prominent rationalist organization based in Berkeley, with the subject: “Can SOMEONE HELP ME I REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SLEEP THIS IS DANGEROUS.” He said in another message that he was scared and did not “know what’s real.”
> 
> Davis would go on to assist at least two other rationalists with mental health episodes, one in late 2017 and again in 2020, he said. While he’s disillusioned with rationalism and the Berkeley nonprofits, Davis does not condemn them for his struggles.
> 
> “It seems spectacularly unfair to blame the philosophy on that,” he said. “I’ve had a few mental health issues along the way, but I probably would’ve had those anyway.”
> 
> In the years since her death, Pasek has become a tragic and almost mythic figure in Zizian lore. But little has been known about her life, until now.
> 
> Her ex-girlfriend, who dated Pasek in the years preceding her death, described her as exceptionally smart and ambitious. Born in 1989 to a supportive family, Pasek attended Jagiellonian University in Krakow, where she studied mathematics and computer science.
> 
> In 2012, Pasek met her future girlfriend — who spoke to the Chronicle on condition of anonymity — through the math society at the university. Both were on the leadership board. “She was an amazing person and very honest when she was talking,” the former girlfriend said. “She appeared very smart from the start.”
> 
> The math club introduced Pasek to rationalism, and soon she and her friends read one of the seminal texts, Eliezer Yudkowsky’s 2010 Harry Potter fan fiction, “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.” Yudkowsky published the book online in serial format, leveraging the fantasy world to explain his thinking.
> 
> Yudkowsky, a self-taught internet philosopher who founded MIRI with early backing from billionaire Peter Thiel, is considered the godfather of rationalism. His views have influenced academics and tech leaders, while fueling the Bay Area rationalist community, which congregated on the online forum he started, LessWrong, and in communal homes, overlapping with the effective altruism movement. Today, Yudkowsky continues to warn of an AI singularity, writing in Time magazine, “If we go ahead on this everyone will die.”
> 
> After finishing school, Pasek began studying for her doctorate before changing course. She accepted an internship programming video games at a company in Japan, where she lived for a year and learned Japanese.
> 
> Then in early 2017, Pasek visited the United States to attend a workshop put on by CFAR. The immersive, four-day seminars, which today cost $3,900, teach guests “how to make more accurate predictions, avoid self-deception, and use arithmetic in ways that better motivate you to action,” according to CFAR’s website.
> 
> An online FAQ for the workshop states that people with high anxiety or emotional volatility should not attend: “The workshop asks participants to jump in with both feet, and much of the content centers around actively wrestling with one’s current problems and goals. If you are under deadline pressure, attached to your status quo, or generally have difficulty dealing with uncertainty and confusion, you may find the workshop overwhelming or destabilizing.”
> 
> After returning to Poland, Pasek decided she should start her own rationalist community. She would launch the project in the Canary Islands, calling it the “Crow’s Nest.”
> 
> The community started small, with Pasek, her girlfriend and two others living in an apartment by the beach. But while Pasek and the others shared an interest in the future of AI, she and her girlfriend soon grew distant.
> 
> “For me, even though it was a nice island, it was also a hard time, especially how it ended,” the ex-girlfriend said.
> 
> In January 2018, Pasek broke off the relationship. The following month, she came out as transgender, changing her name from Chris to Maia. Around the same time, she began speaking of depression and suicidal thoughts. She told her ex-girlfriend, who remained on the island, she needed to fly to Poland for three weeks.
> 
> Pasek kept in touch throughout the trip. But the day she was supposed to return, March 28, her ex-girlfriend woke to terrible news from Pasek’s mother. Pasek had jumped off a building in Krakow. “She never came back,” the ex-girlfriend said.
> 
> Pasek had never mentioned Ziz or the theory of brain hemispheres to her girlfriend. The former partner said she first heard the name when reached by the Chronicle.
> 
> But Pasek left a trail of online postings in the weeks before her suicide that offered clues to her mental state. Her blogs contained dizzying and sometimes extreme guidelines on how people should optimize their thoughts in service of their ultimate values, applying software engineering concepts to the brain.
> 
> In her final post on Feb. 27, 2018, which no longer appears on her blog but is preserved on Ziz’s website, she argued that committing suicide was the “obvious choice” for “bearers of selfish utility functions who expect negative utility.”
> 
> “If I commit suicide, or spend my life on some altruistic pursuit too hastily, I wish to have pre-registered my suicide and also to have made it clear that it was not a fluke/accident/failure of rationality,” Pasek wrote.
> 
> She asked her readers to refrain from posting comments of personal concern; she wasn’t interested in hearing them. To Pasek, suicide was not sad.
> 
> “All the sad things have already happened before the suicide,” she wrote. “What makes such suicide seem sad to you is that you then learn new information about those sad things which have already happened.”
> 
> More than a year and a half later, LaSota wrote about the suicide in a 4,200-word blog post titled “Good Group and Pasek’s Doom.” In her version of events, she and Pasek, along with LaSota’s former roommate on the tugboat, Gwen Danielson, had spent three months experimenting over the internet with a bizarre theory of the mind.
> 
> A mugshot of “Ziz” LaSota, following her arrest in Pennsylvania, shows that deputies had to prop her head up as she went limp.

> Courtesy of Delaware County District Attorney's Office
> LaSota believed that each human brain contained two hemispheres that were often of different genders and moral tendencies. To test the theory, they would attempt to put one hemisphere of the brain to sleep. Through a process they called “debucketing,” the hemispheres could detach, becoming both self-aware and aware of the other.
> 
> The experiment spurred “intense internal conflict” between Pasek’s brain hemispheres, which LaSota believed were split male and female. Pasek’s female side was “suicidal over pains of being trans,” LaSota wrote, while her male hemisphere had “an unhealthy attitude, which had been victorious in the culture we’d generated.”
> 
> To Ziz, Pasek’s suicide was proof that the hemisphere theory had merit. She argued that it was crucial that the mainstream rationalist organizations, CFAR and MIRI, adopt the theory to make hiring decisions, CFAR Executive Director Anna Salamon told the Chronicle in January.
> 
> “LaSota also bragged to me (my interpretation, I admit) that her theory must be cool because it had had a huge effect on her friend Chris/Maia Pasek,” Salamon said in an email. “Namely, it had (according to LaSota) caused Pasek to kill themself.”
> 
> It was after the broader rationalist groups rejected LaSota’s ideas that she splintered from the organizations, Salamon said, apparently using the hemisphere theory to entice her own followers and “manipulate a number of smart, mostly autistic-ish transwomen who were extremely vulnerable and isolated.”
> 
> Pasek’s ex-girlfriend said she was shocked to read Ziz’s blog post, particularly the ending, in which Ziz said the brain experiment did not work out. “If this person was Maia’s friend,” she said, “then she trusted this person. I think it’s not very nice to write such blogs.”
> 
> Even before her involvement in rationalism, Pasek experienced suicidal thoughts, her ex said. Her transition added challenges, she said, and her relationship with Ziz could have exacerbated these.
> 
> “There were many things happening at the same time,” she said. “It’s hard to say what caused it.”
> 
> In March 2016, two years before Pasek’s death, a brainy Texas native named Jay Winterford met Ziz at a rationalist meetup in Berkeley.
> 
> The two found common ground in their veganism and identity as transgender women, and, by LaSota’s telling, Winterford seemed “extremely enthused” by her theories on morality. “Part of me,” Ziz later recalled, “became tunnel-visioned on how I could help this person so much.”
> 
> Growing up in the Houston and Dallas suburbs, Winterford was curious, funny and bright, poring over works of political theory and graduating in the top 10 of her high school class, said Gary and Jeannie Pekarek, her father and stepmother, in an interview.
> 
> Winterford had few interests outside of reading and discussing philosophy, and once sewed herself a tan hooded robe as an homage to a monk’s habit. The teenager, though, “found humor in people’s humanity,” her stepmother said, and delighted in sharing oddball anecdotes such as that Gandhi loved enemas.
> 
> But Jeannie and Gary Pekarek said they couldn’t recall Winterford developing any close relationships in high school. A former classmate who was friendly with her, David Zinsitz, recalled going to her house just once, when they and another teen skipped prom to hang out in Winterford’s room.
> 
> “I think people around him would notice that he stood out and acted differently,” Zinsitz said, using the pronoun Winterford used at the time. “And I think the largest difference was just that he was a really brainy kiddo.”
> 
> Winterford found her niche, however, in the Bay Area’s rationalist community, which she joined shortly after graduating from Trinity University in San Antonio in 2015. Winterford, LaSota and Danielson became close, with the three embarking on a project to avoid Bay Area rents by housing a community of rationalists on boats.
> 
> But both Winterford and LaSota would later describe their relationship as fraught. Points of tension ranged from mundane financial spats to accusations of power grabs and mind control, with LaSota declaring in her blog that Winterford was not “good” and later writing that she and Danielson had attempted to “fix/upgrade” her.
> 
> In her frequent comments on LaSota’s blog, Winterford veered between reverence and disdain for her friend, sometimes within the same posts.
> 
> “You claim to be the only good (or double good, whatever) person I know,” she wrote of Ziz. “You know perfectly well how people react to being told they’re bad and that some other person is good.”
> 
> For reasons that remain unclear to her father and stepmother, Winterford became estranged. They learned she had come out as trans by reading her announcement on Facebook. When they reached out to offer support, Jeannie Pekarek said, she told Winterford she worried about the high rates of suicide among the transgender population. Winterford reassured her stepmother that she would never take her own life, saying that suicide was for “cowards.”
> 
> Soon after that, Winterford stopped communicating.
> 
> Winterford left the Bay Area in 2018, and by late 2020 had settled into a largely solitary life in a cabin her mother owned in Estes Park, Colo. She borrowed some money from her mother to launch a venture that aimed to use light therapy to combat seasonal depression.
> 
> Despite the distance, Winterford maintained regular, sometimes antagonistic contact with LaSota and other rationalists through online forums, receiving messages that were at times bullying and cruel.
> 
> “Ziz has deeply hurt you, and at this point you should probably just give up,” one anonymous commenter posted on Winterford’s blog in November 2020. “Because it seems you are unable to help anybody in saving the world without having yet another mental break and causing collateral damage to people around yourself.”
> 
> In her final days, alone in the cabin following a severe snowstorm, Winterford’s mind apparently kept returning to LaSota and her theories.
> 
> “I have been trying to destroy my system for months out of a belief that it’s done more harm than good,” Winterford wrote in a March 4, 2021, comment on her own blog, noting LaSota’s post on “Pasek’s doom.”
> 
> Around the same time as the post, Winterford visited the local Walmart, where she purchased the shotgun she would soon turn on herself, her family said. While Winterford’s obituary pegs her date of death as March 6, 2021, her body wasn’t discovered until her mother paid a surprise visit to the cabin more than a week later.
> 
> “If you’re at all suicidal, debucketing is a terrible idea,” Winterford had written in the March 4 post. “Doubly so if you force yourself into it because part of you wants to save the world,.”
> 
> While there’s no precise criteria for what qualifies as a “suicide cluster,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines it as “a group of suicides or suicide attempts that occur closer together in time, space, or both than would normally be observed for a community.”
> 
> Suicide clusters are rare, but have been reported in a range of demographics and communities, including high schools and colleges. One stark example came in 2023, when four current or former Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department employees died by suicide in 24 hours.
> 
> But understanding even one suicide is difficult, and it’s often unclear how or if they may relate to one another, said Mark Kaplan, a research professor of social welfare at UCLA who specializes in suicidology.
> 
> Kaplan cautioned against assigning blame on a single factor, noting that there are often multiple contributing internal and external forces. In many cases, suicidal individuals have suffered from long-term depression but also experienced a “precipitating event,” like bullying.
> 
> “So what I’m saying is, let’s not try to make rational something that is really irrational,” he said.
> 
> Still, Kaplan said, some risk factors are overrepresented in suicidal individuals, such as a history of abuse, marginalization and rejection. Exposure to dark subject matters and a “bleak outlook on the world” could also be factors, he said.
> 
> Kaplan noted that the trans community is particularly vulnerable, citing a recent study that found 82% of transgender individuals had considered suicide and 40% had attempted it. “I don’t think there’s a causal factor in all of this,” Kaplan said of the Zizian-adjacent suicides. “There seems to be a lot going on here that might, as a whole, play some role.”
> 
> Mental health crises are not uncommon byproducts or even precursors to cult membership, said Rick Alan Ross, executive director of the Cult Education Institute in New Jersey. “When people become isolated and driven to the extremes by a group leader, they can have a psychotic break,” he said.
> 
> Ross said the Zizians appear to fall within his definition of a destructive cult, with a leader and subject of worship who exercises control over the group through dietary restrictions, sleep withdrawal and isolation. He said the thousands of current and former cult members he has interviewed over the years all enlisted at a vulnerable moment.
> 
> “Happy people don’t join a movement or group for change,” he said. “These seem to be people going through difficulties. It’s not easy being trans, and you can almost see Ziz as an affinity fraud. I am trans and you are trans, so you can trust me.”
> 
> Ultimately, Ross said, the “stress and strain cracks open” the mental health struggles.
> 
> A year before Pasek’s death, a 24-year-old British man flew to Berkeley on a 90-day tourist visa. Previously a MIRI fellow and CFAR student, the young rationalist believed fervently that artificial intelligence would topple humanity if left unchecked.
> 
> “If this happens and it doesn’t act exactly as we want, we are very, very quickly going to lose as a species,” he had warned in a July 2015 YouTube video just before leaving on his first trip to Berkeley. “I think that it’s incredibly dangerous, and I also think it’s inevitable.”
> 
> As he embarked on his second trip to Berkeley in February 2017, the young man — who when reached by the Chronicle asked that his name be withheld for privacy reasons — was hopeful he could make a difference.
> 
> He was also battling his own mental health demons; his family later told authorities he began deteriorating months before leaving. His father, who suffered from schizophrenia, had killed himself four years earlier.
> 
> During his CFAR courses, his cohort mostly studied cognitive exercises detailed in a handbook. In their free time, the members socialized, discussed AI safety and played the “Magic: The Gathering” card game. When a friend visited the young rationalist in Berkeley, he did not recognize him.
> 
> Though the friend remembered him as an “archetypal long-haired, bare-footed, peace-loving intellectual,” he later told a judge that his friend was struggling with mysterious health issues, “seemed perhaps a little psychologically unstable” and was focused on “a new meditation technique he’d been introduced to which allowed him to ‘finally process’ the fact that his father had committed suicide.”
> 
> Soon, the young man checked himself into Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, believing he was suffering renal failure. Doctors found nothing wrong with his kidneys, but diagnosed him with chronic anxiety, according to court records.
> 
> On April 23, 2017, these records show, the young man awoke in an Oakland hotel room. He had left his communal house because he didn’t feel safe. He hadn’t eaten for two days. He called 911 twice, the second time alerting the operator he was a danger to himself, then left before anyone showed up.
> 
> He wound up in San Francisco, where he asked two strangers to get him psychiatric help. Returning to the East Bay, he smashed his head with a landscape stone. It was his second suicide attempt that day, according to court records.
> 
> He wound up at Farm Burger, a restaurant in Berkeley. He told a waitress he was suicidal and needed to get to a psychiatric hospital. A Berkeley police officer and a psychologist on the city’s mobile crisis team headed to Ninth and Gilman streets around 10:30 p.m., but, once again, the young man had left by the time they arrived.
> 
> The psychologist stayed inside her Prius outside a nearby Whole Foods. As she read an article on her phone, she heard a knock on the front passenger door. It was the man in crisis. He opened the door, climbed into the front seat and said he needed a ride. She tried to call for help, she later testified in court, but the man knocked her radio out of her hands and began strangling her. Twice he commanded her to “submit!”
> 
> “My heart sank,” she recalled. “I saw (the radio) go down on the floor. So now I’m looking down, and I’m starting to lose consciousness, and that’s when I realized I needed to start fighting.”
> 
> Somehow, she was able to open her door and scramble out. The man ran off before an officer caught him a block away.
> 
> Prosecutors charged the young Briton with attempted murder, assault, carjacking and robbery. A psychologist who met him in jail concluded he had suffered a psychotic break shortly before the attack, as evidenced by “delusional content” posted to his social media in the days prior. Dr. Benjamin Levin determined the defendant hadn’t slept for three days before his arrest and had thought someone spiked his soup with LSD.
> 
> In early 2019, the man pleaded no contest to attempted murder and received five years in prison. He wrote a handwritten letter to his victim, apologizing and saying he was “horrified” he had attacked an innocent stranger.
> 
> After his release from San Quentin State Prison, he posted about his mental health online. “My psychotic episode was triggered by a confluence of factors,” he wrote, “including acute physical and mental stress, as well as exposure to a range of potent memes.”
> 
> Working to save the human race had also weighed heavily.
> 
> “There’s inherent stress,” he wrote, “in concluding that humanity is heading toward an apocalypse that will kill everyone you care about.”



> Ziz uses UHS [Unihemispheric Sleep] as a secret she rations out to her followers. But the process itself is simple. To perform UHS:
> 
> You need to be tired.
> You need to be laying down or sitting up. (It is important that you stay in a comfortable position that won't require you to move very much.)
> In either case you want to close one eye and keep the other open.
> Distract the open eye with some kind of engagement. (This works best if you have a partner who can help you.)
> Eventually you should feel yourself begin to fall asleep on one side. That side will also become numb. (The degree of numbness is a good way to track how deep into sleep the side is.)
> Once into UHS, it is supposed to be possible to infer which aspects of your personality are associated with which side of the brain. (This is a little farfetched, and the more likely explanation is that it disrupts peoples visceral sense of what is and isn't socially okay.)
> One of the dangers of UHS is that it provides a false sense of rest after waking. If you pay close attention though you'll realize that you are inhibited and need real sleep. It's also unknown if UHS reveals a twin personhood or causes it by desynchronizing the sleeper. You might be giving yourself split personality by using this technique.
> 
> For readers who plan to try anyway we suggest doing it alone or with a trusted friend. A trusted friend means someone who does not have an interest in the results you get (i.e., not Ziz or one of her friends).
> 
> Maia Pasek
> According to someone familiar with the matter Ziz played a large role in the death of Maia Pasek (also known as squirrelinhell). Maia tried UHS as a way to gain awareness of their twin personhood, what Ziz calls "debucketing". We're told these sessions were done with Ziz and involved telling Maia to focus on their suicidal impulses while in a disoriented state. Ziz briefly mentions this in her post Good Group and Pasek's Doom, but skips over the details for obvious reasons. Supposedly Maia began using UHS as an alternative to real sleep. If you paid attention to the previous section you understand that's a bad idea. Between their natural suicidal impulses, the sessions with Ziz, and prolonged sleep deprivation from substituting real sleep with UHS Maia probably had a mental break and committed suicide.
