> Yesterday, September 12, 2018, T-Action activist Alisa Oborotova was killed.
> At about 15:30, she jumped out of the window of her house in the Vyborgsky district, and died a few hours later.
> I don’t know if a trans girl’s suicide can be considered outside the context in which she lived. Even accepting friends, parents, acquaintances are not a guarantee that a person will continue to live.
> Alice said that she often faced threats from strangers on the street and in the subway, who could not determine her gender - although why would they need it. Because of this, Alice was afraid to walk alone on the street.
> She was very sensitive - she was deeply touched by both the events that happened to herself and her loved ones, and the global injustice of the social order. She called herself Social Justice Warrior, knowing full well that this phrase has a negative connotation, and indeed was SJW - in the best possible sense of this phrase.
> Alice administered the T-Action online resources: the Friends of T-Action and T-Action: trans-dating group; telegram-channel T-Action.
> It's hard to believe that Alice is gone. This should not happen to people, but, unfortunately, it happens over and over again, and none of us is immune. Please, take care of yourself. And let us see Alice with dignity.
> It is very important for all of us that her real name is indicated on the tombstone - Alisa Oborotova.
> 
> The fundraising for Alisa's funeral and the organization of the whole process is carried out by her closest friend and our good friend Ira K.
> Requisites for transfer:
> Sberbank card: 4276 5500 4778 8065 (Irina Leonidovna K.)
> Please indicate the purpose of payment "For Alisa's funeral".



Alisa's death was not included in the official TDoR 2018 list. As this piece from 20 Nov 2018 says:

> This year, for me personally, this day will be especially sad. On September 12, 2018, a transgender girl Alisa Oborotova, an activist of the T-Action organization, died in St. Petersburg. She committed suicide by jumping out of her apartment window. According to friends, Alice often faced threats from strangers in public places simply because they could not identify her gender.
> 
> I didn't know her personally, but I do know other members of this organization. I was invited to visit them just a month after the death of Alice. I saw ordinary people around me, who every day are subjected to the same completely irrational social pressure. The only thing I could do at that moment was to empathize by listening to their stories.
> 
> Most likely, Alice will not be included in this year's statistics, although she is a vivid example of a victim of transphobia. May 20 November be not only a day of remembrance, but also a day for making the right decisions and changing attitudes towards transgender people.
