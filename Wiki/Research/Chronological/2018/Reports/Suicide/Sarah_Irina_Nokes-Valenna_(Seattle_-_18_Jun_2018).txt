> I never thought I would had to write one of these, but you've been on my mind a lot lately, and I just wanted to say, I'm sorry if I could had been there more but wasn't. This is such a blow. I'm so very sorry. You deserved more out of life. RIP Sarah, godspeed.



> I remember when I first met Sarah just chatting with her as i was shoping at Target. Who would have known that that moment was a start of a beautiful friendship . I remember when she got out the hospital and she told me that she was no longer working at Target and that she was on the street and was having trouble in the shelters because of her identity. I remember that she have a wonderful disposition and because she showed me the kindness of just opening a conversation with me I tried my best to help her because I know how it is when someone becomes homeless and don't know anywhere to turn. We saved her from the shelter and we took her in at Amy's out house. She was a massive help and even started volunteering at the local women's shelter with me and following in my shadow learning to become a fairy godmother much like myself. She never seen it as work or a something the loaf. She truly enjoyed helping people and being a mentor for those that now only faced homelessness or dysphoria but also disabilities much like her Fibromyalgia and kept getting worse over time but yet she didn't make that her identity. Instead she use this a learning tool to better relate to others who had invisible disabilities. She talked a lot of people and mentored many. I've been so proud of her and her community work she is done. Eventually I made her a honorary fairy godmother and offered her the opportunity to join the valana family. I didn't think she was going to take my offer but the next week she shows me a sheet of paper stating that this is her new name and that we are now sisters. I can honestly say that she was one of the best sisters I've ever had not only did she help others but she help me so much just by giving someone I could talk to when no one else would. Eventually I helped her get her own apartment . And also on disability . It was such a fight but we won together. There was a lot that most people didn't see about her and suffer in the private moments when she would just come to our house just to escape her anxiety and pain even just for just for a few hours. Overtime her seizures and blackouts got worst. And you try to have them where no one could see. She was amazingly respectful. We tried our best to be there for her when times got really rough and I'm so happy that the time I got to spend was meaningful. I understand why she checked out prematurely. Who is mainly because she could not find answers to how to stop the her pain that was troubling her daily basis. That way I'm kind of happy that she's no longer in that pain and suffering. It pains me to say that she was still wish she was hear as selfish as that sounds. . Now all I can do is just hope that she's at peace . She was a good person an amazing fairy godmother. Earned her wings more times over and I can ever count.
