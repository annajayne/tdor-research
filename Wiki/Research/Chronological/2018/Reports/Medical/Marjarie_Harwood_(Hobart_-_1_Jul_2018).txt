kidney disease


> A loveable local transgender person died recently with not many noticing but we did and contacted her family. Martin or Marjorie as she preferred to be called was a person you would see in and around the city almost on a daily basis, and in the Courts quite often too. The charges were of minor nature but did see Marjorie locked up a few times after being refused Bail especially after hours. We got to know Marjorie over a couple of years and offered assistance where we could. Marjorie was also gravely ill with kidney disease. Marjorie’s mother Rose was told by Doctors on the Friday that Marjorie had only weeks to live but sadly died on the Sunday, just two days after of kidney failure. What didn’t help with this illness was the fact that Marjorie had been brutally gang raped in the Risdon Prison Complex with injuries so severe Marjorie was hospitalised and had a colostomy bag fitted Rose said. Marjorie’s health rapidly declined after this incident and was in a depressed state often telling Rose she wanted to die. Marjorie was offered treatment toward the end but refused it, saying she would rather die, scared out of her wits of going back to Gaol. Alcohol was a contributing factor with both the illness and petty offending often involving shoplifting such items as a $2 lipstick at a cheap bargain type retail outlet. Quite rightly so her mother wants answers, answers as to why the Tasmanian Prison Service didn’t look after her, “they had a duty of care and failed.” Rose said the Tasmania Police and Tasmania Prison Service along with other agencies all say how they support gay and transgender people but in reality they don’t, “they just hang them out to dry” she said. “Sex offenders are amongst the protected in Gaol and looked after but they don’t cater for gay or transgender people” Rose said. Speaking with nursing staff at the Royal Hobart Hospital shook her mother as they described the horrific injuries after being brought in from the Gaol. “‘No mother should have to hear that” she said. The other point his mother wants to make is the harassment he copped from certain members of the Tasmania Police force, continually taunting her son about her sexuality and provoking her to ‘Fire up’ then arresting her for resisting arrest, abuse Police, drunk and disorderly charges time and time again. If left alone she’d go about her business and wouldn’t play up but them getting her stirred up whilst she was on the drink of course she’d bite then she’s the worst in the world. Tasmanian Prison Service were given ample opportunity to comment but as usual declined with the usual ‘we don’t comment on individual prisoners.’ Marjorie was farewelled by family and friends a couple of weeks ago at Cornelian Bay and is now at rest her mother told us.

> The Family of Transgender prisoner Marjorie Harwood is calling for an inquest into her death after her abuse in Tasmania’s Risdon Prison. 
> 
> Marjorie Harwood identified as a woman but authorities placed her with men at the Risdon Prison. First arrested in 2009, Marjorie then alleged she suffered verbal and sexual assaults by other inmates. 
> 
> She was subjected to this abuse in Risdon Prison on and off until 2017. While serving another custodial sentence an the men’s prison, she decided to stop treatment for her chronic kidney disease. She died the following year. 
> 
> New Evidence of Mistreatment
> Newly obtained health and correctional records show her gender identity was widely known in the prison and the danger she faced was acknowledged. With this new information, her family is calling for a coronial inquest into her death. 
> 
> In her first correctional health notes in early 2009, a doctor described Marjorie as ‘overtly female’. References to her femininity and gender identity were scattered throughout her health records. 
> 
> Marjorie was eventually placed in the Mersey unit, which is supposedly more secure. However, according to prison records, this failed to keep her safe.
> 
> She sustained injuries throughout 2015 and in 2016 and reported bullying in the Mersey yard. Her mother, Rosemary Harwood, says Marjorie was always fearful of returning to prison. 
> 
> “Nothing was done… every time I used to go over and see her, there was bruises, marks, and she’d always say that she’d been assaulted.”
> 
> In 2017, Marjorie alleged she was raped. Documents show she reported this to a healthcare worker. Not long after this, she passed away after refusing treatment for her kidney disease. 
> 
> Support for an Inquest
> Deaths in custody trigger inquests, but Marjorie’s death occurred outside of custody. However, Ms Harwood’s legal team argues her death is reportable, as it is an “indirect result of injury.”
> 
> Tasmanian Prisoners Legal Service chair Greg Barns SC said Marjorie’s experiences highlight a range of flaws. 
> 
> “What an inquest can do is confirm the failures that took place and confirm the way the system could improve, and take into account what has happened since,” he said.



> During one of her first times in adult prison, Marjorie Harwood was seen for three days sitting with her back against her cell door.
> 
> She told prison officers it made her feel "safer" — no one could approach from behind, she could see in front of her.
> 
> WARNING: This story contains details about sexual assault.
> 
> It was November 2009 and, over the course of the month, Marjorie alleged she was sexually assaulted.
> 
> She also reported to prison officers that she was sick of verbal attacks and of being "targeted" by other inmates.
> 
> She later told officers that nothing had been done about the sexual assault.
> 
> The next month, a nurse noted she had a large, open head wound.
> 
> A transgender rights group is campaigning for change after the alleged gang rape in Tasmania's Risdon Prison of a woman they say never should have been housed with male inmates.
> 
> Marjorie identified as a woman but had been placed with men in Tasmania's Risdon Prison.
> 
> This was to be her life — on and off — until 2017, when she stopped treatment for her chronic kidney disease and died the following year when faced with another custodial sentence with men.
> 
> Newly-obtained health and corrections records during her time in prison show that her identity as a trans woman was widely known in the prison.
> 
> The danger she faced was acknowledged.
> 
> But each time she returned to prison — on non-violent, theft-related offences — she was placed with men.
> 
> Based on this new information, her family is calling for a coronial inquest into her death.
> 
> This service is run by the state government's Tasmanian Health Service.
> 
> Marjorie had identified as female since her teenage years and had attempted hormone therapy several times in her life.
> 
> References to Marjorie's femininity and transgender identity are scattered throughout her correctional health records from each time she was in prison.
> 
> Marjorie was placed in the more secure Mersey unit but this failed to keep her safe, according to prison records.
> 
> In December 2014, a doctor reported she had developed a large gluteal abscess on her buttocks, which she said had been caused by being struck by other inmates.
> 
> The wound required an urgent incision.
> 
> She sustained further injuries in 2015, and in 2016 she reported bullying in the Mersey yard.
> 
> Her mother, Rosemary Harwood, said Marjorie would always be fearful of returning to prison.
> 
> "She'd go to court, and I'd say to the magistrate — once he'd sentenced her — I'd stand up and say, 'Your honour, can you put her somewhere for her safety please?'" Ms Harwood said.
> 
> "But nothing was done … every time I used to go over and see her, there was bruises, marks, and she'd always say that she'd been assaulted.
> 
> "She used to always say to me, when she'd come out: 'They're killing me, mum.'"
> 
> When Marjorie entered Risdon prison for the final time in 2017, her foundation plan recorded "transgender" in the gender field.
> 
> The Tasmania Prison Service (TPS) argued this was the first documented occasion where it was made aware of her gender identity.
> 
> The TPS reported she spent the sentence from June to September in prison inpatient care or at the Royal Hobart Hospital.
> 
> Marjorie's kidney condition had deteriorated. It is during this sentence that she alleged she was raped.
> 
> Marjorie had later mentioned it to a health worker and it was documented in a hospital patient care report.
